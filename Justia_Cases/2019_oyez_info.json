To obtain a handgun license, an individual must apply with a local licensing officer\u2014which, in New York City, is the police commissioner\u2014and the application process involves an investigation into the applicant\u2019s mental health history, criminal history, and moral character. There are two primary types of handgun licenses: \u201ccarry\u201d licenses and \u201cpremises\u201d licenses. This case involves the latter, which permits the licensee to \u201chave and possess in his dwelling\u201d a pistol or revolver. The premises license is specific to a particular address, and the handguns permitted by the license may not be removed from that address except in limited circumstances prescribed by law. One such circumstance is to \u201ctransport his/her handgun(s) directly to and from an authorized small arms range/shooting club, unloaded, and in a locked container, the ammunition to be carried separately.\u201d All small arms ranges/shooting clubs authorized under the rule are located in New York City.</p>\n<p>Three individuals with premises licenses sought to transport their handguns to shooting ranges and competitions outside New York City\u2014which is prohibited by the rule. One of the individuals sought to transport his handgun between the premises in New York City for which it was licensed and his second home in Hancock, New York\u2014which the rule also prohibits. The three individuals and petitioner New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association filed a lawsuit in federal district court, asking the court to declare the city\u2019s restrictions unconstitutional and to enjoin the city from enforcing them.</p>\n<p>The district court found the rule \u201cmerely regulates rather than restricts the right to possess a firearm in the home and is a minimal, or at most, modest burden on the right\u201d and thus did not violate plaintiffs\u2019 Second Amendment rights. The district court also held that the rule did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, the First Amendment right of expressive association, or the fundamental right to travel. Reviewing the district court\u2019s decision de novo, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does a New York City rule banning the transportation a licensed, locked, and unloaded handgun to a home or shooting range outside city limits violate the Second Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or the constitutional right to travel?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 37772, "name": "Paul D.

Over 90% of the effluent/groundwater mixture enters the ocean through diffuse flow, with no identifiable entry point.

Klemm filed a collections lawsuit against Rotkiske in March 2008 but was unable to locate him for service of process. Klemm refiled its suit in January 2009 and attempted to serve Rotkiske at the same address. Unbeknownst to Rotkiske, someone at that address accepted service on his behalf, and Klemm obtained a default judgment against him. Rotkiske only discovered the judgment when he applied for a mortgage in September 2014.</p>\n<p>Rotkiske filed the present action against Klemm alleging that its actions violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Klemm moved to dismiss the claim as time-barred, and the district court granted the motion to dismiss. The FDCPA provides that any action under the Act must be brought \u201cwithin one year from the date on which the violation occurs.\u201d Rotkiske argued that the statute incorporates a \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d which is recognized in both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits and which \u201cdelays the beginning of a limitations period until the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury.\u201d The district court rejected this argument, finding that under a plain reading of the statute, the limitations period begins at the time of injury. Rotkiske appealed, but before the appellate panel issued its opinion and judgment, the Third Circuit ordered rehearing <em>en banc</em>. The Third Circuit, sitting <em>en banc</em>, affirmed the judgment of the district court.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the statute of limitations under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act begin when the violation is discovered or when the violation occurred?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The statute of limitations in \u00a7 1692k(d) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act begins to run when the alleged FDCPA violation occurs, not when it is discovered. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the 8-1 majority affirming the judgment below. The Court first looked at the statutory language of the FDCPA, finding that the plain meaning of the statute of limitations unambiguously refers to the date of the alleged violation. The Court rejected Rotkiske\u2019s argument that the statute incorporates a \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d that would delay the beginning of the limitations period until the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury, finding the \u201catextual judicial supplementation...particularly inappropriate.\u201d The Court declined to consider Rotkiske\u2019s fraud-based equitable defense because he failed to preserve that argument when he appealed to the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor authored a concurring opinion to point out that the Court has \u201clong recognized\u201d the equitable \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d in cases of fraud or concealment, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s disparagement of that rule in its opinion in this case.</p>\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored a dissenting opinion in which she agrees with the majority\u2019s determination that the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d does not apply to the one-year statute of limitations in the FDCPA, but she disagrees with the majority that Rotkiske failed to preserve a fraud-based discovery argument in the court below. Justice Ginsburg would hold that if the conduct giving rise to the claim is fraudulent, or if fraud infects the manner in which the claim is presented, then the fraud-based discovery rule governs. Because, in her view, Rotkiske did preserve this argument on appeal, she would allow adjudication of his claim on the merits.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 62840, "name": "Scott E.

Dr. Klingemann assigned his application to NantKwest Inc., and in 2010, the examiner rejected the application as obvious. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirmed the rejection.</p>\n<p>When the Board affirms an examiner\u2019s rejection of a patent application, the applicant may either appeal directly to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or challenge the Board\u2019s decision in district court (under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145). Pursuant to \u00a7 145, NantKwest challenged the Board\u2019s decision by filing a complaint in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The court granted the PTO\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the Federal Circuit affirmed. After its victory on the merits, PTO filed a motion for reimbursement of \u201cthe expenses of the proceedings\u201d under \u00a7 145, including almost $80,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and over $33,000 in expert witness fees.</p>\n<p>Applicants who invoke \u00a7 145 are required by statute to pay \u201c[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\u201d incurred by the PTO in defending the Board\u2019s decision, regardless of the outcome. Historically, the PTO has used this requirement to recover payment for expenses such as travel, printing, and expert witnesses.</p>\n<p>The district court denied PTO\u2019s motion with respect to attorney\u2019s fees, citing the American Rule\u2014a \u201cbedrock principle\u201d in this country that \u201ceach litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose\u201d unless there is an \u201cexpress grant from Congress.\u201d A panel of the Federal Circuit reversed, and then the circuit voted to hear the appeal <em>en banc</em>. After requesting briefing on the single question whether \u00a7 145 authorizes award of attorney\u2019s fees, the <em>en banc</em> Federal Circuit concluded that it does not, affirming the district court.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the phrase \u201c[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\u201d in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 include attorneys\u2019 fees?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The Patent and Trademark Office cannot recover the salaries of its legal personnel as \u201cexpenses\u201d in civil actions brought by patent applicants pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.</p>\n<p>Under the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d there is a presumption that each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees unless a statute or contract provides otherwise. That presumption is particularly important in the context of proceedings challenging the rejection of a patent application because allowing the agency to recover fees from a prevailing party would be a \u201cradical departure\u201d from the norm. The plain text\u2014use of the word \u201cexpenses\u201d\u2014does not provide adequate basis from departing from the strong presumption that the American Rule applies. Nor does the history of the Patent Act support such an expansive reading of the term.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 36722, "name": "Malcolm L.

A records check revealed that he was already the subject of an investigation, and police contacted his employer to obtain employment documents. Among the documents was his federal Form I-9, which listed a social security number belonging to another person. Further investigation revealed that Garcia had used the same number on other federal and state forms. On the basis of this information, Garcia was charged with identity theft under state law.</p>\n<p>In <em>State v. Morales</em>, a special agent with the Social Security Administration determined that Donaldo Morales was using a social security number issued to another person. The agent reviewed Morales\u2019s employment file, which included a federal Form I-9 as well as various federal and state tax forms. Morales was charged with identity theft and two other state-law offenses.</p>\n<p>In <em>State v. Ochoa-Lara</em>, federal and state officers determined that Guadalupe Ochoa-Lara was using a social security number issued to another individual to lease an apartment.

By the next year, the formerly happy couple was heading toward divorce, and Kahler allegedly became abusive toward his wife and estranged from their children. Kahler increasingly suffered from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, and though he saw several psychologists and psychiatrists who prescribed antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and sleep aids, he refused to take his medications as directed.</p>\n<p>In November 2009, Kahler went to his wife\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, where his family was visiting, and shot and killed his wife, his two daughters, and the grandmother. Kahler was arrested, charged, and sentenced to death for the four killings. Experts for the defense and the prosecution agreed that Kahler exhibited major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive, borderline, paranoid, and narcissistic personality tendencies.

Part of his job was to participate in tandem skydives with clients, in which he was necessarily strapped in close proximity to the client. A gay man, Zarda sometimes told female clients about his sexual orientation to address any concern they might have about being strapped to a man for a tandem skydive. On one occasion after Zarda informed a female client about his sexual orientation and performed the tandem jump with her, the client alleged that Zarda had inappropriately touched her and disclosed his sexual orientation to excuse his behavior. In response to this complaint, Zarda's boss fired him. Zarda denied touching the client inappropriately and claimed that he was fired solely because of his reference to his sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Zarda filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claiming that he was fired because of his sexual orientation and also because of he did not conform to male gender stereotypes. He brought a claim in federal court alleging, among other things, that Altitude Express violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by terminating him because of his sexual orientation. The district court ruled for Altitude Express, finding that Title VII does not protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation. After the district court's ruling, the EEOC issued an opinion in a separate case (persuasive but not binding on federal district courts) that Title VII's \u201con the basis of sex\u201d language necessarily includes discrimination \u201con the basis of sexual orientation.\u201d In light of this decision, Zarda moved for the district court to reinstate his Title VII claim, but the district court denied the motion, citing binding Second Circuit precedent, <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/232/33/514971/\"><em>Simonton v. Runyon</em>, 232 F.3d 33 (2d Cir. 2000)</a>, and <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/398/211/597672/\"><em>Dawson v. Bumble &amp; Bumble</em>, 398 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2005)</a>.</p>\n<p>Zarda appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled for Altitude Express as well. The panel declined Zarda\u2019s request that it reconsider its interpretation of Title VII and overturn <em>Simonton</em> and <em>Dawson</em>, as only the court sitting en banc can do that. The Second Circuit then agreed to rehear the case en banc and expressly overruled <em>Simonton</em> and <em>Dawson</em>, finding, consistent with the EEOC\u2019s position, that Title VII\u2019s prohibition on discrimination because of sex necessarily includes discrimination because of sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>This case is consolidated for oral argument with <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1618\"><em>Bostock v.

During his ten-year career with Clayton County, Bostock received positive performance evaluations and numerous accolades. In 2013, Bostock began participating in a gay recreational softball league. Shortly thereafter, Bostock received criticism for his participation in the league and for his sexual orientation and identity generally. During a meeting in which Bostock\u2019s supervisor was present, at least one individual openly made disparaging remarks about Bostock\u2019s sexual orientation and his participation in the gay softball league. Around the same time, Clayton County informed Bostock that it would be conducting an internal audit of the program funds he managed. Shortly afterwards, Clayton County terminated Bostock allegedly for \u201cconduct unbecoming of its employees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Within months of his termination, Bostock filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Three years later, in 2016, he filed a pro se lawsuit against the county alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court dismissed his lawsuit for failure to state a claim, finding that Bostock\u2019s claim relied on an interpretation of Title VII as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, contrary to a 1979 decision holding otherwise, the continued which was recently affirmed in <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/15-15234/15-15234-2017-03-10.html\"><em>Evans v.

Three years later, in 1992, he became a lawful permanent resident. In 1996, a few months before he had been in the country for seven years, Barton was charged with and convicted of three felonies: aggravated assault, first-degree criminal damage to property, and possession of a firearm during the possession of a felony. In 2007 and 2008, he was charged with and convicted of violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. After these offenses, the Department of Homeland Security served Barton with a notice to appear, charging him as removable (deportable) on several grounds. Barton conceded removability as to two of the charges but denied two of them. He also gave notice of his intent to seek cancellation of removal as a lawful permanent resident. The immigration judge sustained the two conceded charges, and the government withdrew the other two charges.</p>\n<p>Barton then filed an application for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), which allows the attorney general to cancel the removal of an otherwise removable lawful permanent resident if, among other things, the individual \u201chas resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.\u201d This residency requirement is subject to a \u201cstop-time rule\u201d which terminates the accrual of continuous residency when the individual commits a statutorily described crime that renders the individual \u201cinadmissible\u201d or \u201cremovable.\u201d The government argued that Barton had not accrued the seven years of continuous residence since his admission to the United States in 1989 because his 1996 crimes triggered the time-stop rule. In response, Barton argued that his 1996 crimes did not trigger the stop-time rule because as an already-admitted lawful permanent resident who was not seeking admission or readmission to the United States, he could not as a matter of law be \u201crendered inadmissible\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1229b(a).</p>\n<p>The immigration judge ruled in the government\u2019s favor, and in a non-precedential single-member decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision.

Frescati owned and operated the oil tanker, which had nearly completed its 1,900-mile journey to its destination berth on the Delaware River. To reach its intended berth, the tanker needed to pass through Federal Anchorage Number 9, a federally designated section of the river in which ships may anchor. That area is periodically surveyed for depth and dredged by the Army Corps of Engineers, but no government agency is responsible for preemptively searching for obstructions. Anyone who wishes to search for obstructions in that area may do so, but dredging requires a permit from the Corps of Engineers.</p>\n<p>As it passed through this section of the river, the tanker hit an abandoned anchor, causing approximately 264,000 gallons of crude oil to spill into the river. The cleanup cost was $143 million.</p>\n<p>Frescati originally paid for the cleanup and was then reimbursed $88 million by the federal government, under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Frescati and the United States filed a lawsuit seeking a portion of costs from CITGO, the intended recipient of the oil.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of what turned out to be extensive litigation, the district court initially found that CITGO was not liable under contract or tort law. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the decision in part after determining that Frescati was a third-party beneficiary of CITGO\u2019s safe berth warranty and that CITGO had a duty of care to Frescati (thus implicating liability under both contract and tort theories). On remand, the district court found CITGO liable under both contract and tort. However, the court also found that the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Army Corps of Engineers misled CITGO into believing the anchorage was free of obstructions and reduced CITGO\u2019s liability by 50%. The government, CITGO, and Frescati all appealed, and the Third Circuit affirmed the contract claim, vacated the negligence claim, and affirmed in part other claims.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Under federal maritime law, is a safe-berth clause in a voyage charter contract a guarantee of a ship\u2019s safety or a duty of due diligence?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 19760, "name": "Carter G.

Dudenhoeffer</em>, 573 U.S. __ (2014)</a>, the Supreme Court unanimously held that under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), fiduciaries to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) are not entitled to a presumption of prudence regarding their decisions to buy or hold employer stock. Rather, for a plaintiff to state a claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of prudence based on inside information, the plaintiff need only \u201cplausibly allege that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant\u2019s position could not have concluded that [an alternative action] would do more harm than good to the fund.\u201d Thus the Court established a \u201ccontext-specific\u201d pleading standard rather than a generalized presumption standard.</p>\n<p>IBM offers as a benefit to its employees an ERISA-qualified ESOP, invested predominantly in IBM common stock, with Retirement Plans Committee of IBM as the fiduciary. In 2015, two substantially similar lawsuits were filed against IBM and its officers, one under securities laws and the other under ERISA. Both lawsuits alleged that IBM fraudulently concealed problems with the company\u2019s microelectronics unit, thereby artificially inflating IBM\u2019s reported value. By continuing to invest in IBM stock despite allegedly knowing that the market price was artificially inflated due to the fraudulent scheme, the plaintiffs in the ERISA lawsuit argued that the ESOP\u2019s fiduciaries breached their duty of prudence under Section 404 of ERISA.</p>\n<p>The district court dismissed the ERISA lawsuit for failure to state a claim, finding that the plaintiffs failed to meet the pleading standard established in <em>Fifth Third</em>, as they had not alleged facts showing that the fiduciaries \u201ccould not have concluded\u201d that publicly disclosing the alleged \u201cfraud\u201d or halting further investments in IBM stock would be more likely to harm the fund than to help it.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs amended their complaint to add generic allegations that disclosure of the alleged fraud was \u201cinevitable\u201d and that the magnitude of the stock price correction resulting from a delayed disclosure would increase over time. The plaintiffs also added a claim that the fiduciaries could have avoided doing more harm than good by instead purchasing a \u201clow-cost\u201d hedging product.</p>\n<p>The district court again dismissed the lawsuit for failing to meet the <em>Fifth Third</em> pleading standard and because a prudent fiduciary could reasonably find their proposed alternative likely to cause more harm than good. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, finding that \u201cwhen a \u2018drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund\u2019 is inevitable, it is far more plausible that a prudent fiduciary would prefer to limit the effects of the stock\u2019s artificial inflation on the ESOP\u2019s beneficiaries through prompt disclosure.\u201d</p>\n", "question": "<p>Do generalized allegations that the harm of an inevitable disclosure of an alleged fraud generally increases over time satisfy the \u201cmore harm than good\u201d pleading standard for ERISA claims the Court established in <em>Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer</em>?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>In a per curiam (unsigned) opinion, the Court vacated the judgment below and remanded the case to the Second Circuit to determine whether to entertain the parties\u2019 arguments on ERISA\u2019s duty of prudence.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 37772, "name": "Paul D.

In 1977, Atlantic Richfield purchased Anaconda Smelter, and it shut down smelter activities in 1980. The smelter operations over the almost-century of operations caused high concentrations of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium, and zinc to contaminate soil, groundwater, and surface water. In 1983, the EPA prioritized the Anaconda Smelter site as a Superfund site, working with Atlantic Richfield to address the contamination. Since then, Atlantic Richfield has worked with the EPA for 35 years to remediate the site, at a cost of approximately $470 million.</p>\n<p>In 2008, landowners within the Anaconda Superfund site sued Atlantic Richfield in Montana state court, alleging that the smelter operations between 1884 and 1980 had caused damage to their properties. Atlantic Richfield raised no objections to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of loss of use and enjoyment of property, diminution of value, incidental and consequential damages, and annoyance and discomfort. However, it did object to the common-law claim for \u201crestoration\u201d damages.</p>\n<p>To establish a claim for restoration damages in Montana, plaintiffs must prove that they will actually use the award to clean up the site. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that restoration of their property requires \u201cwork in excess of what the EPA required of Atlantic Richfield in its selected remedy.\u201d Atlantic Richfield moved for summary judgment, arguing that the restoration claim constituted a \u201cchallenge\u201d to the EPA\u2019s remedy and thus was jurisdictionally barred by CERCLA \u00a7 113, which deprives courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges to EPA-selected remedies. Atlantic Richfield also argued that the landowners are \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d and thus must seek EPA approval under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9622(e)(6) of CERCLA before engaging in remedial action. Finally, Atlantic Richfield argued that CERCLA preempted state common-law claims for restoration.</p>\n<p>The trial court held that CERCLA permitted plaintiffs\u2019 claim for restoration damages, and Atlantic Richfield sought a writ of supervisory control from the Montana Supreme Court, which the court granted.

Around age 11, he began drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and he dropped out of school in the seventh grade. He repeatedly tried to run away from home and was placed in juvenile detention.</p>\n<p>In 1991, when McKinney was 23, he and his half-brother Michael Hedlund committed two burglaries that resulted in two deaths. The state of Arizona tried McKinney and Hedlund before dual juries. McKinney\u2019s jury found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder (without specifying whether it reached that verdict by finding premeditation or by finding felony murder), and Hedlund\u2019s jury found him guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p>At McKinney\u2019s capital sentencing hearing (before a judge), a psychologist testified that he had diagnosed McKinney with PTSD \u201cresulting from the horrific childhood McKinney had suffered.\u201d The psychologist further testified that witnessing violence could trigger McKinney\u2019s childhood trauma and produce \u201cdiminished capacity.\u201d The trial judge credited the psychologist\u2019s testimony, but under Arizona law at the time, the judge was prohibited from considering non-statutory mitigating evidence that the judge found to be unconnected to the crime. Because McKinney\u2019s PTSD was not connected to the burglaries, the judge could not consider it mitigating evidence and thus sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p>The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed McKinney\u2019s death sentence on appeal. In 2003, McKinney filed a habeas petition in federal court. The district court denied relief, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and held that the Arizona courts had violated the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-5727\"><em>Eddings v. Oklahoma</em>, 455 U.S. 104 (1982)</a>, by refusing to consider McKinney\u2019s PTSD. In Eddings, the Court held that a sentencer in a death penalty case may not refuse consider any relevant mitigating evidence. A violation of <em>Eddings</em>, the Ninth Circuit held, required resentencing. Thus, the Ninth Circuit remanded to the federal district court to either correct the constitutional error or vacate the sentence and impose a lesser sentence. Arizona moved for independent review of McKinney\u2019s sentence by the Arizona Supreme Court; McKinney opposed the motion on the ground that he was entitled to resentencing by a jury under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2001/01-488\"><em>Ring v. Arizona</em>, 536 U.S. 584 (2002)</a>, which held that juries, rather than judges, must make the findings necessary to impose the death penalty. The Arizona Supreme Court disagreed, finding that McKinney was not entitled to resentencing by a jury because his case was \u2018final\u2019 before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Ring</em>.</p>\n", "question": "<ol><li>Was the Arizona Supreme Court required to apply current law, rather than the law as it existed at the time a defendant\u2019s conviction became final, when weighing mitigating and aggravating evidence to determine whether a death sentence is warranted?</li>\n<li>Does the correction of error under <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-5727\"><em>Eddings v.

Ritzen claims that Jackson breached the contract by providing erroneous documentation about the property just before the deadline, while Jackson claims Ritzen breached by failing to secure funding to purchase the property by the deadline.</p>\n<p>Ritzen sued Jackson for breach of contract in Tennessee state court, and just before trial, Jackson filed for bankruptcy, triggering an automatic stay of the litigation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. Ritzen filed a motion to lift the stay, which the bankruptcy court denied, and Ritzen did not appeal the denial. Instead, Ritzen brought a claim against the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy court ruled for Jackson, finding that Ritzen, not Jackson, breached the contract.</p>\n<p>After this adverse ruling, Ritzen filed two appeals in the district court. The first appeal arose from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying relief from the automatic stay (which Ritzen did not appeal at the time). The second appeal arose from the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that Ritzen, not Jackson, breached the contract. The district court ruled against Ritzen on both appeals; the first appeal was untimely filed, and the second one failed on the merits.</p>\n<p>Ritzen appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which reviewed the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact under the abuse of discretion standard and its legal conclusions de novo. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding that Ritzen had missed two deadlines: the contract deadline, leading to its breach, and the appeal deadline, leading to its waiver of appeal.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is an order denying a motion for relief from the automatic stay in bankruptcy proceeding a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1)?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>A bankruptcy court\u2019s order unreservedly denying relief from the automatic stay constitutes a final, immediately appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a).

Applying that reasoning to the facts of this case, the Court found that a bankruptcy court\u2019s order unreservedly granting or denying relief from a bankruptcy\u2019s automatic stay conclusively resolves a discrete dispute and thus qualifies as an independent \u201cproceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7158(a).</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 63184, "name": "James K.

In September 2016, Guerrero filed a motion to reopen, claiming that the 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in <em>Matter of Abdelghany</em> rendered him eligible to seek relief under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c). The immigration judge denied Guerrero\u2019s motion to reopen, finding it not timely filed. Given that <em>Abdelghany</em> was decided in 2014, the immigration judge found the two-year delay in filing the motion to reopen indicated Guerrero had not diligently pursued his rights as required for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the BIA affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen, finding that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. And the BIA agreed with the immigration judge that equitable tolling did not apply to extend the 90-day deadline. Guerrero argued that he could not have filed his motion to reopen until the Fifth Circuit issued its decision in <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/14-60865/14-60865-2016-07-28.html\"><em>Lugo-Resendez v.

The annotations are prepared pursuant to an agreement between Mathew Bender &amp; Co., an operating division of the LexisNexis Group, and the State of Georgia, under which the state exercises pervasive supervisory control by way of its Code Revision Commission, a body established by the Georgia General Assembly. The Commission is comprised of the Lieutenant Governor, four members of the Georgia Senate, the Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, four additional members of the Georgia House of Representatives, and five members appointed by the president of the State Bar of Georgia.</p>\n<p>Public.Resource.Org (PRO) is a non-profit organization with a mission of improving public access to government records and primary legal materials.

It also distributed digital copies to Georgia legislators and other organizations and websites.</p>\n<p>The Commission sent PRO several cease-and-desist letters on the grounds that publication infringes on the State of Georgia\u2019s copyright in their work, but PRO persisted. The Commission sued PRO in 2015 in federal district court, seeking injunctive relief. PRO acknowledged its publication and dissemination of the OCGA but denied that the State of Georgia holds an enforceable copyright in the Code. The district court ruled for the Commission, finding that because the annotations of the OCGA lack the force of law, they are not public domain material. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding that because of the way they are written and integrated into the \u201cofficial\u201d code, the annotations in the OCGA are attributable to the constructive authorship of the People and are thus intrinsically public domain material. To reach this conclusion, the Eleventh Circuit examined the identity of the public officials who created the work, the authoritativeness of the work, and the process by which the work was created\u2014finding that each of these markers supported the conclusion that the People were constructively the authors of the annotations.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the government edict doctrine extend to\u2014and thus render uncopyrightable\u2014the annotations in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 63194, "name": "Joshua S.

Exacerbated by a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis came to a head in 2015, when its governor announced that the Commonwealth was in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d and was unable to pay its debt. In June 2016, President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016 (PROMESA), which gave him authority to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board that would have control over Puerto Rico\u2019s budget and would negotiate the restructuring of its $125 billion indebtedness. President Obama appointed the seven-member board in August 2016 based on lists supplied by Republic and Democratic lawmakers.</p>\n<p>A number of creditors and elected officials of Puerto Rico have been dissatisfied with the board and its decisions and brought a lawsuit challenging President Obama\u2019s authority to appoint the board members. The challengers alleged that the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that the Senate confirm high-level federal officers and that the board members were within the scope of this Clause. The federal district court in Puerto Rico ruled against the creditors, finding the board is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government established pursuant to Congress\u2019s plenary powers under the Territorial Clause and that the board members are not \u201cOfficers of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the Territorial Clause does not supersede the application of the Appointments Clause in an unincorporated territory and that the board members are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d because: (1) they occupy \u201ccontinuing positions,\u201d (2) exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d that is the same or more than that exercised by other officers the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d and (3) exercise their authority \u201cpursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d Moreover, these officers are \u201cprincipal\u201d officers subject to the Appointments Clause because they are answerable to and removable only by the President and are not directed or supervised by others who were appointed by the President with Senate confirmation.</p>\n", "question": "<ol><li>Does the Appointments Clause govern the appointment of members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico?</li>\n<li>Does the de facto officer doctrine allows courts to deny meaningful relief to successful separation-of-powers challengers who are suffering ongoing injury at the hands of unconstitutionally appointed principal officers?</li>\n</ol>", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 21656, "name": "Donald B.

When Sudan and Iran did not appear to defend these cases, the district court entered default judgments against them in several cases, including $4.3 billion in punitive damages. Sudan then appeared, filing appeals and motions to vacate the judgments. The district court denied Sudan\u2019s motions to vacate, and Sudan again appealed.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that FSIA does not permit the recovery of punitive damages arising from terrorist activities that occurred before Congress amended the law in 2008 to authorize punitive damages.

The defendants raised the argument that the plaintiffs had not suffered any financial loss and moved to dismiss the remainder of the action.

While there, she helped to develop the Geriatric Pharmacotherapy Clinic (GPC), which serves older veterans with diseases or disabilities common to individuals of advanced age with military service. In 2009, the Pharmacy Management gave Babb an advanced scope (full practice authority) to prescribe medications without a physician, which was necessary for her position. In 2010, the VA rolled out a nationwide treatment initiative similar to the GPC Babb had helped develop. Against recommendations by Human Resources and despite requests from doctors, Pharmacy Management rejected applications by several current module pharmacists\u2014all females over 50\u2014and granted applications of two pharmacists under 40.</p>\n<p>Two of the female pharmacists who were denied advancement filed Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaints, and Babb provided statements and testified in support of their EEO claims. The pharmacists claimed that their non-selection purportedly for lack of advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination and that any justification for denying advanced scopes was pretext for discrimination as well.</p>\n<p>Babb alleged that as a result of her participation in the EEO process, she was denied opportunities to participate in the new program and that Pharmacy Management required her to agree to a schedule that was unworkable for her department. Unable to meet this requirement, Babb\u2019s advanced scope was removed and was consequently disqualified from promotion. A female pharmacist under 30 without an advanced scope was selected for the promotion.</p>\n<p>Babb brought this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) alleging that she was the victim of gender-plus-age discrimination and that the VA retaliated against her for participating in protected EEO in violation of those laws. The district court granted summary judgment for the VA. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Babb argued that the district court erred in part by not allowing her to prove that illegal discrimination or retaliation was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d behind the VA\u2019s refusal to promote her. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower court, finding itself bound by precedent that federal sector employees\u2019 claims under ADEA and Title VII require that the plaintiff show discrimination or retaliation is a \u201cbut for\u201d factor in the adverse personnel action.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) that protects federal employees aged 40 years from age discrimination require a plaintiff to prove that age was a but-for cause of the challenged personnel action?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 56052, "name": "Roman Martinez", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/roman_martinez", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Martinez", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "roman_martinez"}, "advocate_description": "for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/22827"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 37093, "name": "Noel J.

In November 2007, while Outokumpu\u2019s plant was under construction, the company\u2019s predecessor, ThyssenKrupp, entered into three contracts with F.L. Industries (\u201cFives\u201d) to provide three different-sized mills.

The two parties contest the scope of Marcel\u2019s release of claims, with Marcel contending that it only released claims as to infringement that occurred prior to the 2003 execution of the agreement and Lucky Brand arguing that it released any future claim Marcel may have in relation to any trademark registered prior to the execution of the agreement. Further litigation ensued.</p>\n<p>In litigation between the two parties over substantially the same trademark disputes, Lucky Brand argued for its interpretation of the 2003 settlement agreement. It moved to dismiss on the basis that because the marks at issue were registered prior to the settlement agreement, Marcel released any claim alleging infringement of those marks. The district court denied the motion, concluding that it was premature to determine which claims were subject to release in the 2001 agreement. However, the district court noted that Lucky Brand was \u201cfree to raise the issue . . . again after the record is more fully developed.\u201d Lucky Brand raised the defense again in its answer and as an affirmative defense, but not again during the litigation. After a jury trial, the district court entered judgment for Marcel, declaring that Lucky Brand infringed on Marcel\u2019s \u201cGet Lucky\u201d trademark and enjoining Lucky Brand from using the \u201cGet Lucky\u201d mark. Lucky Brand did not appeal.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Marcel filed another lawsuit against Lucky Brand alleging that the latter continued to use \u201cLucky Brand\u201d mark after the injunction. Lucky Brand moved for summary judgment on the basis that Marcel\u2019s claims were precluded by res judicata in light of the final disposition of the previous action. The district court agreed, but the Second Circuit reversed, finding the allegedly barred claims \u201ccould not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.\u201d On remand, Marcel filed a second amended complaint, which Lucky Brand moved to dismiss on the sole basis that the 2001 agreement barred Marcel\u2019s claims. The district court granted the motion and rejected Marcel\u2019s argument that Lucky Brand was precluded from raising those claims.</p>\n<p>The Second Circuit vacated, concluding that the doctrine of claim preclusion (or more precisely, defense preclusion) applied in situations as this one and that it barred Lucky Brand from invoking its release defense again in this action.</p>\n", "question": "<p>When a plaintiff asserts new claims, can federal preclusion principles bar a defendant from raising defenses that were not actually litigated and resolved in any prior case between the parties?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 20721, "name": "Dale M.

In 2002, Fossil and Romag entered into an agreement to use Romag fasteners in Fossil\u2019s products, and Fossil\u2019s manufacturers purchased tens of thousands of Romag fasteners between 2002 and 2008. In 2010, the president of Romag discovered that certain Fossil handbags sold in the United States contained counterfeit snaps bearing the Romag mark. Romag sued Fossil in 2010 for patent and trademark infringement. Romag alleged that Fossil knowingly adopted and used the Romag mark without Romag\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p>A jury found that Fossil had infringed Romag\u2019s trademark and patents but that none of the violations were willful. The jury awarded Romag trademark damages under two theories: over $90,000 in profits \u201cto prevent unjust enrichment\u201d and over $6.7 million in profits \u201cto deter future trademark infringement.\u201d For the latter award, the jury found that Fossil had acted with \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for Romag\u2019s trademark rights. However, the district court struck the jury\u2019s award, finding that \u201ca finding of willfulness remains a requirement for an award of defendants\u2019 profits in this Circuit.\u201d On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, finding that within the Second Circuit, a showing of willfulness was required for an award of profits.

(UWBI) was in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings when it received a tax refund check from the Internal Revenue Service that was the result of net operating losses incurred by one of UWBI\u2019s subsidiaries (United Western Bank). UWBI and its subsidiaries had entered into a tax allocation agreement in 2008 that was the source of the present ownership dispute. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) alleged that, as receiver for the Bank, it was entitled to the federal tax refund that was due because the refund stemmed exclusively from the Bank\u2019s business loss carrybacks. Simon Rodriguez, in his capacity as the Chapter 7 Trustee for the bankruptcy estate of UWBI, initiated a bankruptcy adversary proceeding against the FDIC, alleging that UWBI owned the tax refund and thus that it was part of the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy court agreed with Rodriguez and entered summary judgment. The FDIC appealed to federal district court, which reversed the bankruptcy court. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court. Under federal common law, \u201ca tax refund due from a joint return generally belongs to the company responsible for the losses that form the basis of the refund.\u201d Applying this rule and noting that the agreement\u2019s intended treatment of tax refunds mandates the same result, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the tax refund at issue belonged to the Bank and thus that the FDIC, as receiver for the Bank, was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does federal common law or the law of the relevant state determine the ownership of a tax refund paid to an affiliated group?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 63196, "name": "Mitchell P.

In recent cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a \u201ccategorical\u201d approach to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the ACCA.

Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr. arrived on the scene and detained one of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s friends on U.S. territory. Hern\u00e1ndez ran into Mexican territory and stood by a pillar near the culvert. From U.S. territory, Mesa fired at least two shots across the border at Hern\u00e1ndez, one of which struck Hern\u00e1ndez in the face and killed him.</p>\n<p>Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s parents filed a lawsuit against the officer and various other defendants alleging violation of their son\u2019s Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and part and reversed in part. The Fifth Circuit held that Hern\u00e1ndez lacked Fourth Amendment rights, but his parents were entitled to a remedy under <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/301\"><em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents</em>, 403 U.S. 388 (1971)</a> (holding an implied cause of action against federal government officials who have violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights), and the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity. On rehearing en banc, the full Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the parents\u2019 claims, holding that they had failed to state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment and that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not \u201cclearly established\u201d that it was unconstitutional for an officer on U.S. soil to shoot a Mexican national on Mexican soil.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in 2016 and reversed the en banc Fifth Circuit as to qualified immunity. The Court remanded the case so the lower court could determine whether the shooting violated Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and whether his parents could assert claims for damages under <em>Bivens</em>. On remand, the en banc Fifth Circuit once again affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, holding that the excessive force claim was unlike any that had been decided previously and thus the plaintiffs were not entitled to any remedy under <em>Bivens</em>. In so holding, the Fifth Circuit applied the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2016/15-1358\"><em>Ziglar v. Abbasi</em>, 582 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, in which the Court held that for a new type of claim to be cognizable under <em>Bivens</em>, there must be some special factor makes the judiciary better suited than the legislature to recognize such a claim.\u00a0</p>\n", "question": "<p>Should federal courts recognize a damages claim under <em>Bivens</em> if plaintiffs plausibly allege that a rogue federal law enforcement officer violated clearly established Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for which there is no alternative legal remedy?</p>\n", "conclusion": null, "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 62842, "name": "Stephen I.

The parties do not dispute the authority of a new administration to replace old policies with new policies, but the plaintiffs in this and related challenges allege that the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather than in compliance with the law. Specifically, the Trump administration terminated DACA based on a conclusion that the Obama administration had created DACA \u201cwithout proper statutory authority and with no established end-date\u201d and thus that it was an \u201cunconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in this case and the related cases challenged this conclusion of law, alleging that the recission of DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was arbitrary and capricious, and because it was a substantive rule that did not comply with the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment requirements.

First, the district court held Adams had Article III (\u201cconstitutional\u201d) standing as to some, but not all of the provisions, but that because he had prudential standing to the other provisions, it would consider his challenge as to all of them. Turning to the merits, the district court noted that under the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-1520\"><em>Elrod v. Burns</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-1520\"><em>Branti v.

The rule provided that a nonprofit religious employer who objects to providing contraceptive services may file an accommodation form requesting an exemption to the requirement, thereby avoiding paying for or otherwise participating in the provision of contraception to its employees.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-354\"><em>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</em>, 573 U.S. 682 (2014)</a>, the Supreme Court held that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), closely-held for-profit corporations were also entitled to invoke the exemption if they had sincere religious objections to the provision of contraceptive coverage. Then, in <em>Wheaton College v. Burwell</em>, 573 U.S. 958, (2014), the Court held that an entity seeking an exemption did not need to file the accommodation form; rather, its notification to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was sufficient to receive the exemption. HHS and the Departments of Labor and Treasury promulgated a final rule in compliance with these rulings.</p>\n<p>Then, in <a><em>Zubik v. Burwell</em>, 578 U.S. __ (2017)</a>, the Court considered another challenge the rule, which asserted that merely submitting the accommodation notice \u201csubstantially burden[ed] the exercise of their religion,\u201d in violation of RFRA. In a per curiam opinion, the Court declined to reach the merits of that question.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration promulgated regulations that greatly expanded the entities eligible to claim an exemption to the requirement that group health insurance plans cover contraceptive services.
