The employees filed a grievance with their union, including the age discrimination issues but also asserting that the transfer violated their collective bargaining agreement. The union pursued the employees' collective bargaining claim through Penn Plaza's arbitration system; however, the employees themselves pursued their age discrimination claim in federal court under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Penn Plaza argued that the arbitration clause included in the employment contract, stating that all age discrimination claims must be pursued through arbitration, prevented the employees from bringing the claim in federal court. The district court ruled in favor of the employees, holding the arbitration clause unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the ruling, relying on its previous decisions holding that arbitration clauses with respect to statutory claims, such as the ADEA, are unenforceable.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Are arbitration clauses in employment contracts -- waiving an employee's right to bring statutory claims in federal court -- enforceable?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law. With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Anthony G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that ,here, the arbitration provision was a \"bargained-for exchange\" in the collective bargaining agreement and thus should not be interfered with by the courts. The Court went on to state that because the ADEA itself did not mandate such interference, the arbitration provision should be enforced.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissenting opinion. He noted that the majority opinion was a departure from Supreme Court precedent with respect to arbitration clauses in collective bargaining agreements. He went on to state that it was it was Congress' responsibility to reassess the policy arguments favoring arbitration rather than for the Supreme Court to decide. Justice David H. Souter also wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer. He reemphasized that Supreme Court precedent did not preclude the pursuit of an ADEA claim because of an arbitration provision in a collective bargaining agreement, as in this case.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 38374, "name": "Paul Salvatore", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/paul_salvatore", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Salvatore", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "paul_salvatore"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19664"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 20869, "name": "David C.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621 et seq., lose their statutory right to bring an ADEA claim in court, \u00a7626(c).  Under the 35- year-old holding in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), they do not, and I would adhere to stare decisis and so hold today.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e et seq., the ADEA is aimed at \u201c\u00a0\u2018the elimination of discrimination in the workplace,\u2019\u00a0\u201d McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 358 (1995) (quoting Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750, 756 (1979)), and, again like Title VII, the ADEA \u201ccontains a vital element \u2026\u00a0: It grants an injured employee a right of action to obtain the authorized relief,\u201d 513 U. S., at 358.  \u201cAny person aggrieved\u201d under the Act \u201cmay bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for legal or equitable relief,\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7626(c), thereby \u201cnot only redress[ing] his own injury but also vindicat[ing] the important congressional policy against discriminatory employment practices,\u201d  Gardner-Denver, supra, at 45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gardner-Denver considered the effect of a CBA\u2019s arbitration clause on an employee\u2019s right to sue under Title VII.  One of the employer\u2019s arguments was that the CBA entered into by the union had waived individual employees\u2019 statutory cause of action subject to a judicial remedy for discrimination in violation of Title VII.  Although Title VII, like the ADEA, \u201cdoes not speak expressly to the relationship between federal courts and the grievance-arbitration machinery of collective-bargaining agreements,\u201d 415 U. S., at 47, we unanimously held that \u201cthe rights conferred\u201d by Title VII (with no exception for the right to a judicial forum) cannot be waived as \u201cpart of the collective bargaining process,\u201d id., at 51.  We stressed the contrast between two categories of rights in labor and employment law.  There were \u201cstatutory rights related to collective activity,\u201d which \u201care conferred on employees collectively to foster the processes of bargaining[, which] properly may be exercised or relinquished by the union as collective-bargaining agent to obtain economic benefits for union members.\u201d  Ibid.  But \u201cTitle VII \u2026 stands on plainly different [categorical] ground; it concerns not majoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities.\u201d  Ibid.  Thus, as the Court previously realized, Gardner-Denver imposed a \u201cseemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights.\u201d  Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525 U. S. 70, 80 (1998).[Footnote 1]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We supported the judgment with several other lines of complementary reasoning.  First, we explained that antidiscrimination statutes \u201chave long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination,\u201d and Title VII\u2019s statutory scheme carried \u201cno suggestion \u2026 that a prior arbitral decision either forecloses an individual\u2019s right to sue or divests federal courts of jurisdiction.\u201d  Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 47.  We accordingly concluded that \u201can individual does not forfeit his private cause of action if he first pursues his grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d  Id., at 49.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, we rejected the District Court\u2019s view that simply participating in the arbitration amounted to electing the arbitration remedy and waiving the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue.  We said that the arbitration agreement at issue covered only a contractual right under the CBA to be free from discrimination, not the \u201cindependent statutory rights accorded by Congress\u201d in Title VII.  Id., at 49\u201350.  Third, we rebuffed the employer\u2019s argument that federal courts should defer to arbitral rulings.  We declined to make the \u201cassumption that arbitral processes are commensurate with judicial processes,\u201d id., at 56, and described arbitration as \u201ca less appropriate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the federal courts,\u201d id., at 58.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we took note that \u201c[i]n arbitration, as in the collective bargaining process, the interests of the individual employee may be subordinated to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\u201d ibid., n.\u00a019, a result we deemed unacceptable when it came to Title VII claims.  In sum, Gardner-Denver held that an individual\u2019s statutory right of freedom from discrimination and access to court for enforcement were beyond a union\u2019s power to waive.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our analysis of Title VII in Gardner-Denver is just as pertinent to the ADEA in this case.  The \u201cinterpretation of Title VII \u2026 applies with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA \u2018were derived in haec verba from Title VII,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and indeed neither petitioners nor the Court points to any relevant distinction between the two statutes.  Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)); see also McKennon, 513 U. S., at 358 (\u201cThe ADEA and Title VII share common substantive features and also a common purpose\u201d).  Given the unquestionable applicability of the Gardner-Denver rule to this ADEA issue, the argument that its precedent be followed in this case of statutory interpretation is equally unquestionable.  \u201cPrinciples of stare decisis \u2026 demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of interpretation change or stay the same.  Were that not so, those principles would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which the rule of law depends.\u201d  CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14).  And \u201c[c]onsiderations of stare decisis have special force\u201d over an issue of statutory interpretation, which is unlike constitutional interpretation owing to the capacity of Congress to alter any reading we adopt simply by amending the statute.  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172\u2013173 (1989).  Once we have construed a statute, stability is the rule, and \u201cwe will not depart from [it] without some compelling justification.\u201d  Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991).  There is no argument for abandoning precedent here, and Gardner-Denver controls.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority evades the precedent of Gardner-Denver as long as it can simply by ignoring it.  The Court never mentions the case before concluding that the ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7151 et seq., \u201cyiel[d] a straightforward answer to the question presented,\u201d ante, at 10, that is, that unions can bargain away individual rights to a federal forum for antidiscrimination claims.  If this were a case of first impression, it would at least be possible to consider that conclusion, but the issue is settled and the time is too late by 35 years to make the bald assertion that \u201c[n]othing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.\u201d  Ante, at 9.  In fact, we recently and unanimously said that the principle that \u201cfederal forum rights cannot be waived in union-negotiated CBAs even if they can be waived in individually executed contracts \u2026 assuredly finds support in\u201d our case law, Wright, 525 U. S., at 77, and every Court of Appeals save one has read our decisions as holding to this position, Air Line Pilots Assn., Int\u2019l v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 199 F.\u00a03d 477, 484 (CADC 1999) (\u201cWe see a clear rule of law emerging from Gardner-Denver and Gilmer [v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991)]: \u2026 an individual may prospectively waive his own statutory right to a judicial forum, but his union may not prospectively waive that right for him.  All of the circuits to have considered the meaning of Gardner-Denver after Gilmer, other than the Fourth, are in accord with this view\u201d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equally at odds with existing law is the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he decision to fashion a CBA to require arbitration of employment-discrimination claims is no different from the many other decisions made by parties in designing grievance machinery.\u201d  Ante, at 7.  That is simply impossible to square with our conclusion in Gardner-Denver that \u201cTitle VII \u2026 stands on plainly different ground\u201d from \u201cstatutory rights related to collective activity\u201d: \u201cit concerns not majoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities.\u201d  415 U. S., at 51; see also Atchison, T. & S. F. R.\u00a0Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 565 (1987) (\u201c[N]otwithstanding the strong policies encouraging arbitration, \u2018different considerations apply where the employee\u2019s claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 737 (1981))).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the majority does speak to Gardner-Denver, it misreads the case in claiming that it turned solely \u201con the narrow ground that the arbitration was not preclusive because the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\u201d  Ante, at 12.  That, however, was merely one of several reasons given in support of the decision, see Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 47\u201359, and we raised it to explain why the District Court made a mistake in thinking that the employee lost his Title VII rights by electing to pursue the contractual arbitration remedy, see id., at 49\u201350.  One need only read Gardner-Denver itself to know that it was not at all so narrowly reasoned, and we have noted already how later cases have made this abundantly clear.  Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S., at 737, provides further testimony:\n\u201cNot all disputes between an employee and his employer are suited for binding resolution in accordance with the procedures established by collective bargaining.  While courts should defer to an arbitral decision where the employee\u2019s claim is based on rights arising out of a collective-bargaining agreement, different considerations apply where the employee\u2019s claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThese considerations were the basis for our decision in [Gardner-Denver].\u201d\n\nSee also Gilmer, supra, at 35 (\u201cAn important concern\u201d in Gardner-Denver \u201cwas the tension between collective representation and individual statutory rights \u2026\u201d).  Indeed, if the Court can read Gardner-Denver as resting on nothing more than a contractual failure to reach as far as statutory claims, it must think the Court has been wreaking havoc on the truth for years, since (as noted) we have unanimously described the case as raising a \u201cseemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights.\u201d  Wright, supra, at 80.[Footnote 2]  Human ingenuity is not equal to the task of reconciling statements like this with the majority\u2019s representation that Gardner-Denver held only that \u201cthe arbitration was not preclusive because the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\u201d  Ante, at 12.[Footnote 3]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor, finally, does the majority have any better chance of being rid of another of Gardner-Denver\u2019s statements supporting its rule of decision, set out and repeated in previous quotations: \u201cin arbitration, as in the collective-bargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\u201d ante, at 20 (citing 415 U. S., at 58, n.\u00a019), an unacceptable result when it comes to \u201can individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities,\u201d id., at 51.  The majority tries to diminish this reasoning, and the previously stated holding it supported, by making the remarkable rejoinder that \u201c[w]e cannot rely on this judicial policy concern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.\u201d  Ante, at 20.[Footnote 4]  It is enough to recall that respondents are not seeking to \u201cintroduc[e] a qualification into\u201d the law; they are justifiably relying on statutory-interpretation precedent decades old, never overruled, and serially reaffirmed over the years.  See, e.g., McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984); Barrentine, supra, at 742.  With that precedent on the books, it makes no sense for the majority to claim that \u201cjudicial policy concern[s]\u201d about unions sacrificing individual antidiscrimination rights should be left to Congress.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that matter, Congress has unsurprisingly understood Gardner-Denver the way we have repeatedly explained it and has operated on the assumption that a CBA cannot waive employees\u2019 rights to a judicial forum to enforce antidiscrimination statutes.  See, e.g., H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p.\u00a097 (1991) (stating that, \u201cconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII in [Gardner-Denver],\u201d \u201cany agreement to submit disputed issues to arbitration \u2026 in the context of a collective bargaining agreement \u2026 does not preclude the affected person from seeking relief under the enforcement provisions of Title VII\u201d).  And Congress apparently does not share the Court\u2019s demotion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding to a suspect judicial policy concern: \u201cCongress has had [over] 30 years in which it could have corrected our decision \u2026 if it disagreed with it, and has chosen not to do so.  We should accord weight to this continued acceptance of our earlier holding.\u201d  Hilton, 502 U. S., at 202; see also Patterson, 491 U. S., at 172\u2013173.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one level, the majority opinion may have little effect, for it explicitly reserves the question whether a CBA\u2019s waiver of a judicial forum is enforceable when the union controls access to and presentation of employees\u2019 claims in arbitration, ante, at 24\u201325, which \u201cis usually the case,\u201d McDonald, supra, at 291.  But as a treatment of precedent in statutory interpretation, the majority\u2019s opinion cannot be reconciled with the Gardner-Denver Court\u2019s own view of its holding, repeated over the years and generally understood, and I respectfully dissent.\n\u00a0Gardner-Denver also contained some language seemingly prohibiting even individual prospective waiver of federal forum rights, see 415 U. S., at 51\u201352, an issue revisited in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), and not disputed here.\nThe majority seems inexplicably to think that the statutory right to a federal forum is not a right, or that Gardner-Denver failed to recognize it because it is not \u201csubstantive.\u201d  Ante, at 7, n.\u00a05.  But Gardner-Denver forbade union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights in large part because of the importance of such rights and a fear that unions would too easily give them up to benefit the many at the expense of the few, a far less salient concern when only economic interests are at stake.  See, e.g., Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 737 (1981).\n\u00a0There is no comfort for the Court in making the one point on which we are in accord, that Gardner-Denver relied in part on what the majority describes as \u201cbroad dicta that was highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination rights.\u201d  Ante, at 15\u201316.  I agree that Gardner-Denver\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018mistrust of the arbitral process\u2019 \u2026 has been undermined by our recent arbitration decisions,\u201d Gilmer, supra, at 34, n.\u00a05 (quoting Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231 (1987)), but if the statements are \u201cdicta,\u201d their obsolescence is as irrelevant to Gardner-Denver\u2019s continued vitality as their currency was to the case\u2019s holding when it came down; in Gardner-Denver itself we acknowledged \u201cthe federal policy favoring arbitration,\u201d 415 U. S., at 46, n.\u00a06, but nonetheless held that a union could not waive its members\u2019 statutory right to a federal forum in a CBA.\n\u00a0The majority says it would be \u201cparticularly inappropriate\u201d to consider Gardner-Denver\u2019s conflict-of-interest rationale because \u201cCongress has made available\u201d another \u201cavenue\u201d to protect workers against union discrimination, namely, a duty of fair representation claim.  Ante, at 22.  This answer misunderstands the law, for unions may decline for a variety of reasons to pursue potentially meritorious discrimination claims without succumbing to a member\u2019s suit for failure of fair representation.  See, e.g., Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 742 (\u201c[E]ven if the employee\u2019s claim were meritorious, his union might, without breaching its duty of fair representation, reasonably and in good faith decide not to support the claim vigorously in arbitration\u201d).  More importantly, we have rejected precisely this argument in the past, making this yet another occasion where the majority ignores precedent.  See, e.g., ibid.; Gardner-Denver, supra, at 58, n.\u00a019 (noting that a duty of fair representation claim would often \u201cprove difficult to establish\u201d).  And we were wise to reject it.  When the Court construes statutes to allow a union to eliminate a statutory right to sue in favor of arbitration in which the union cannot represent the employee because it agreed to the employer\u2019s challenged action, it is not very consoling to add that the employee can sue the union for being unfair."}, {"id": 1758, "title": "Dissenting opinion", "author": null, "type": {"value": "dissenting", "label": "Dissenting opinion"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962917, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/247/dissent.html", "judge_full_name": "John Paul Stevens", "judge_last_name": "Stevens", "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1758", "justia_text": "14 PENN PLAZA LLC, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.\nSTEVEN PYETT et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[April 1, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Souter\u2019s dissenting opinion, which I join in full, explains why our decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), answers the question presented in this case.  My concern regarding the Court\u2019s subversion of precedent to the policy favoring arbitration prompts these additional remarks.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the absence of change in any relevant statutory provision, the Court has recently retreated from, and in some cases reversed, prior decisions based on its changed view of the merits of arbitration.  Previously, the Court approached with caution questions involving a union\u2019s waiver of an employee\u2019s right to raise statutory claims in a federal judicial forum.  After searching the text and purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court in Gardner-Denver held that a clause of a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) requiring arbitration of discrimination claims could not waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum for statutory claims.  See 415 U. S., at 51.  The Court\u2019s decision rested on several features of the statute, including the individual nature of the rights it confers, the broad remedial powers it grants federal courts, and its expressed preference for overlapping remedies.  See id., at 44\u201348.  The Court also noted the problem of entrusting a union with certain arbitration decisions given the potential conflict between the collective interest and the interests of an individual employee seeking to assert his rights.  See id., at 58, n.\u00a019.  That concern later provided a basis for our decisions in Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 742 (1981), and McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984), which similarly held that a CBA may not commit enforcement of certain rights-creating statutes exclusively to a union-controlled arbitration process.  Congress has taken no action signaling disagreement with those decisions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutes construed by the Court in the foregoing cases and in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953), have not since been amended in any relevant respect.  But the Court has in a number of cases replaced our predecessors\u2019 statutory analysis with judicial reasoning espousing a policy favoring arbitration and thereby reached divergent results.  I dissented in those cases to express concern that my colleagues were making policy choices not made by Congress.  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 640 (1985); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 486 (1989); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 36 (1991); and Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 124 (2001).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today the majority\u2019s preference for arbitration again leads it to disregard our precedent.  Although it purports to ascertain the relationship between the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the National Labor Relations Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act, the Court ignores our earlier determination of the relevant provisions\u2019 meaning.  The Court concludes that \u201c[i]t was Congress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty\u201d that the system of organized labor \u201cnecessarily demands,\u201d even when the sacrifice demanded is a judicial forum for asserting an individual statutory right.  Ante, at 22.  But in Gard-\nner-Denver we determined that \u201cCongress\u2019 verdict\u201d was otherwise when we held that Title VII does not permit a CBA to waive an employee\u2019s right to a federal judicial forum.  Because the purposes and relevant provisions of Title VII and the ADEA are not meaningfully distinguishable, it is only by reexamining the statutory questions resolved in Gardner-Denver through the lens of the policy favoring arbitration that the majority now reaches a different result.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the circumstances, I believe a passage from one of my earlier dissents merits repetition.  The Court in Rodriguez de Quijas overruled our decision in Wilko and held that predispute agreements to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 are enforceable.  490 U. S., at 484; see also id., at 481 (noting Wilko\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe outmoded presumption of disfavoring arbitration proceedings\u201d).  I observed in dissent:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn the final analysis, a Justice\u2019s vote in a case like this depends more on his or her views about the respective lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests.  Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of us who are inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters\u2019 representatives on nonconstitutional matters.  Cf. Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500 (1988).  As I pointed out years ago, Alberto-Culver Co. v. Scherk, 484 F.\u00a02d 611 (CA7 1973) (dissenting opinion), rev\u2019d, 417 U. S. 506 (1974), there are valid policy and textual arguments on both sides regarding the interrelation of federal securities and arbitration Acts.  None of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years.\u201d  Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U. S., at 487 (footnote and citation omitted).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As was true in Rodriguez de Quijas, there are competing arguments in this case regarding the interaction of the relevant statutory provisions.  But the Court in Gardner-Denver considered these arguments, including \u201cthe federal policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\u201d 415 U. S., at 59, and held that Congress did not intend to permit the result petitioners seek.  In the absence of an intervening amendment to the relevant statutory language, we are bound by that decision.  It is for Congress, rather than this Court, to reassess the policy arguments favoring arbitration and revise the relevant provisions to reflect its views.\n\u00a0Referring to the potential conflict between individual and collective interests, the Court asserts that it \u201ccannot rely on this judicial policy concern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.\u201d  Ante, at 21.  That potential conflict of interests, however, was a basis for our decision in several pertinent cases, including Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), and Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 35 (1991), and in the intervening years Congress has not seen fit to correct that interpretation.  The Court\u2019s derision of that \u201cpolicy concern\u201d is particularly disingenuous given its subversion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding in the service of an extratextual policy favoring arbitration."}, {"id": 1759, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962918, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/247/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1759", "justia_text": "14 PENN PLAZA LLC et\u00a0al. v. PYETT et\u00a0al.\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\nNo. 07\u2013581.\u2003Argued December 1, 2008\u2014Decided April 1, 2009\nRespondents are members of the Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ (Union).  Under the National Labor Relations Act, the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees within the building-services industry in New York City, which includes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons.  The Union has exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their \u201crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment,\u201d 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7159(a), and engages in industry-wide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York City real-estate industry.  The agreement between the Union and the RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contractors and Building Owners (CBA).  The CBA requires union members to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding arbitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance and dispute resolution procedures.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.  It owns and operates the New York City office building where respondents worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities.  Respondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Industries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.  After 14 Penn Plaza, with the Union\u2019s consent, engaged a unionized security contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security guards for the building, Temco reassigned respondents to jobs as porters and cleaners.  Contending that these reassignments led to a loss in income, other damages, and were otherwise less desirable than their former positions, respondents asked the Union to file grievances alleging, among other things, that petitioners violated the CBA\u2019s ban on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on the basis of their age in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621 et seq.  The Union requested arbitration under the CBA, but after the initial hearing, withdrew the age-discrimination claims on the ground that its consent to the new security contract precluded it from objecting to respondents\u2019 reassignments as discriminatory.  Respondents then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners had violated their ADEA rights, and the EEOC issued each of them a right-to-sue notice.  In the ensuing lawsuit, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of respondents\u2019 age discrimination claims.  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, forbids enforcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring arbitration of ADEA claims. \nHeld:\u00a0A provision in a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law.  Pp.\u00a06\u201325.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a straightforward answer to the question presented.  The Union and the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bargained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimination claims, including ADEA claims, would be resolved in arbitration.  This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a \u201cconditio[n] of employment\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining under the NLRA, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7159(a).  See, e.g., Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 199.  As in any contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for other concessions from the employer, and courts generally may not interfere in this bargained-for exchange.  See NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328.  Thus, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep.  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628.  It does not.  This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of claims brought under the statute.  See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26\u201333.  Pp.\u00a06\u201310.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.  Pp.\u00a06\u201310.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the Gardner-Denver line of cases.  Respondents incorrectly interpret Gardner-Denver and its progeny as holding that an agreement to arbitrate ADEA claims provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement cannot waive an individual employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum under federal antidiscrimination statutes..  Pp.\u00a011\u201323.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\u00a0The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered.  Those cases \u201cdid not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims,\u201d but \u201cthe quite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.\u201d  Gilmer, supra, at 35.  Gardner-Denver does not control the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining agreement\u2019s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.  Pp.\u00a011\u201315. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii)\u00a0Apart from their narrow holdings, the Gardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vindicate statutory antidiscrimination rights.  That skepticism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.  First, contrary to Gardner-Denver\u2019s erroneous assumption, 415 U. S., at 51, the decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek relief from a court in the first instance, see, e.g., Gilmer, supra, at 26.  Second, Gardner-Denver\u2019s mistaken suggestion that certain informal features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited to the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca comparatively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of [employment] rights.\u201d  415 U. S., at 56, has been corrected.  See, e.g., Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 232.  Third, Gardner-Denver\u2019s concern that, in arbitration, a union may subordinate an individual employee\u2019s interests to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit, 415 U. S., at 58, n.\u00a019, cannot be relied on to introduce a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the Gardner-Denver dicta, there is \u201cno reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read.\u201d  Mitsubishi, supra, at 628.  In any event, the conflict-of-interest argument amounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the NLRA, see Emporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization, 420 U. S. 50, 62, and Congress has accounted for the conflict in several ways: union members may bring a duty of fair representation claim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability under the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the National Labor Relations Board.  Pp.\u00a015\u201323. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Because respondents\u2019 arguments that the CBA does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims were not raised in the lower courts, they have been forfeited.  Moreover, although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld, see, e.g., Mitsubishi, supra, at 637, and n.\u00a019, this Court is not positioned to resolve in the first instance respondents\u2019 claim that the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that this question would require resolution of contested factual allegations, was not fully briefed here or below, and is not fairly encompassed within the question presented.  Resolution now would be particularly inappropriate in light of the Court\u2019s hesitation to invalidate arbitration agreements based on speculation.  See, e.g., Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621 et seq., is enforceable.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that this Court\u2019s decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), forbids enforcement of such arbitration provisions.  We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents are members of the Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ (Union).  Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as amended, the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees within the building-services industry in New York City, which includes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons.  See 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7159(a).  In this role, the Union has exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their \u201crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d  Ibid.  Since the 1930\u2019s, the Union has engaged in industry-wide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York City real-estate industry.  The agreement between the Union and the RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contractors and Building Owners (CBA).  The CBA requires union members to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding arbitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance and dispute resolution procedures:\n\u201c\u00a730 NO DISCRIMINATION.  There shall be no discrimination against any present or future employee by reason of race, creed, color, age, disability, national origin, sex, union membership, or any other characteristic protected by law, including, but not limited to, claims made pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Code, \u2026 or any other similar laws, rules, or regulations.  All such claims shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures (Articles V and VI) as the sole and exclusive remedy for violations.  Arbitrators shall apply appropriate law in rendering decisions based upon claims of discrimination.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a.[Footnote 1]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.  It owns and operates the New York City office building where, prior to August 2003, respondents worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities.  Respondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Industries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.  In August 2003, with the Union\u2019s consent, 14 Penn Plaza engaged Spartan Security, a unionized security services contractor and affiliate of Temco, to provide licensed security guards to staff the lobby and entrances of its building.  Because this rendered respondents\u2019 lobby services unnecessary, Temco reassigned them to jobs as night porters and light duty cleaners in other locations in the building.  Respondents contend that these reassignments led to a loss in income, caused them emotional distress, and were otherwise less desirable than their former positions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At respondents\u2019 request, the Union filed grievances challenging the reassignments.  The grievances alleged that petitioners: (1) violated the CBA\u2019s ban on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on account of their age; (2) violated seniority rules by failing to promote one of the respondents to a handyman position; and (3) failed to equitably rotate overtime.  After failing to obtain relief on any of these claims through the grievance process, the Union requested arbitration under the CBA.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the initial arbitration hearing, the Union withdrew the first set of respondents\u2019 grievances\u2014the age-discrimination claims\u2014from arbitration.  Because it had consented to the contract for new security personnel at 14 Penn Plaza, the Union believed that it could not legitimately object to respondents\u2019 reassignments as discriminatory.  But the Union continued to arbitrate the seniority and overtime claims, and, after several hearings, the claims were denied.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May 2004, while the arbitration was ongoing but after the Union withdrew the age-discrimination claims, respondents filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners had violated their rights under the ADEA.  Approximately one month later, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights, which explained that the agency\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018review of the evidence \u2026 fail[ed] to indicate that a violation ha[d] occurred,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and notified each respondent of his right to sue.

Pennsylvania Building Co., 498 F.\u00a03d 88, 91 (CA2 2007).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents thereafter filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that their reassignment violated the ADEA and state and local laws prohibiting age discrimination.[Footnote 2]  Petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration of respondents\u2019 claims pursuant to \u00a73 and \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73, 4.[Footnote 3]  The District Court denied the motion because under Second Circuit precedent, \u201ceven a clear and unmistakable union-negotiated waiver of a right to litigate certain federal and state statutory claims in a judicial forum is unenforceable.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.  Respondents immediately appealed the ruling under \u00a716 of the FAA, which authorizes an interlocutory appeal of \u201can order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title\u201d or \u201cdenying a petition under section 4 of this title to order arbitration to proceed.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a716(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  498 F.\u00a03d 88.  According to the Court of Appeals, it could not compel arbitration of the dispute because Gardner-Denver, which \u201cremains good law,\u201d held \u201cthat a collective bargaining agreement could not waive covered workers\u2019 rights to a judicial forum for causes of action created by Congress.\u201d  498 F.\u00a03d, at 92, 91, n.\u00a03 (citing Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 49\u201351).  The Court of Appeals observed that the Gardner-Denver decision was in tension with this Court\u2019s more recent decision in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), which \u201cheld that an individual employee who had agreed individually to waive his right to a federal forum could be compelled to arbitrate a federal age discrimination claim.\u201d  498 F.\u00a03d, at 91, n.\u00a03 (citing Gilmer, supra, at 33\u201335; emphasis in original).  The Court of Appeals also noted that this Court previously declined to resolve this tension in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525 U. S. 70, 82 (1998), where the waiver at issue was not \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d  498 F.\u00a03d, at 91, n.\u00a03.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals attempted to reconcile Gardner-Denver and Gilmer by holding that arbitration provisions in a collective-bargaining agreement, \u201cwhich purport to waive employees\u2019 rights to a federal forum with respect to statutory claims, are unenforceable.\u201d  498 F.\u00a03d, at 93\u201394.  As a result, an individual employee would be free to choose compulsory arbitration under Gilmer, but a labor union could not collectively bargain for arbitration on behalf of its members.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), to address the issue left unresolved in Wright, which continues to divide the Courts of Appeals,[Footnote 4] and now reverse.\nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The NLRA governs federal labor-relations law.  As permitted by that statute, respondents designated the Union as their \u201cexclusive representativ[e] \u2026 for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d  29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7159(a).  As the employees\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative, the Union \u201cenjoys broad authority \u2026 in the negotiation and administration of [the] collective bargaining contract.\u201d  Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 739 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this broad authority \u201cis accompanied by a responsibility of equal scope, the responsibility and duty of fair representation.\u201d  Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U. S. 335, 342 (1964).  The employer has a corresponding duty under the NLRA to bargain in good faith \u201cwith the representatives of his employees\u201d on wages, hours, and conditions of employment.  29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7158(a)(5); see also  \u00a7158(d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this instance, the Union and the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bargained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimination claims, including claims brought under the ADEA, would be resolved in arbitration.  This freely negotiated term between the Union and the RAB easily qualifies as a \u201cconditio[n] of employment\u201d that is subject to mandatory bargaining under \u00a7159(a).  See Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 199 (1991) (\u201c[A]rrangements for arbitration of disputes are a term or condition of employment and a mandatory subject of bargaining\u201d); Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 578 (1960) (\u201c[A]rbitration of labor disputes under collective bargaining agreements is part and parcel of the collective bargaining process itself\u201d); Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 455 (1957) (\u201cPlainly the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to strike\u201d).  The decision to fashion a CBA to require arbitration of employment-discrimination claims is no different from the many other decisions made by parties in designing grievance machinery.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents, however, contend that the arbitration clause here is outside the permissible scope of the collective-bargaining process because it affects the \u201cemployees\u2019 individual, non-economic statutory rights.\u201d  Brief for Respondents 22; see also post, at 5\u20136 (Souter, J., dissenting).  We disagree.  Parties generally favor arbitration precisely because of the economics of dispute resolution.  See Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 123 (2001) (\u201cArbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the costs of litigation, a benefit that may be of particular importance in employment litigation, which often involves smaller sums of money than disputes concerning commercial contracts\u201d). As in any contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for other concessions from the employer.  Courts generally may not interfere in this bargained-for exchange.  \u201cJudicial nullification of contractual concessions \u2026 is contrary to what the Court has recognized as one of the fundamental policies of the National Labor Relations Act\u2014freedom of contract.\u201d  NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328 (1974) (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep.  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985).  It does not.  This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of claims brought under the statute.  See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 26\u201333.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Gilmer, the Court explained that \u201c[a]lthough all statutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration, \u2018having made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be held to it unless Congress itself has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 26 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 628).  And \u201cif Congress intended the substantive protection afforded by the ADEA to include protection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that intention will be deducible from text or legislative history.\u201d  500 U. S., at 29 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  The Court determined that \u201cnothing in the text of the ADEA or its legislative history explicitly precludes arbitration.\u201d  Id., at 26\u201327.  The Court also concluded that arbitrating ADEA disputes would not undermine the statute\u2019s \u201cremedial and deterrent function.\u201d  Id., at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the end, the employee\u2019s \u201cgeneralized attacks\u201d on \u201cthe adequacy of arbitration procedures\u201d were \u201cinsufficient to preclude arbitration of statutory claims,\u201d id., at 30, because there was no evidence that \u201cCongress, in enacting the ADEA, intended to preclude arbitration of claims under that Act,\u201d id., at 35.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Gilmer Court\u2019s interpretation of the ADEA fully applies in the collective-bargaining context.  Nothing in the law suggests a distinction between the status of arbitration agreements signed by an individual employee and those agreed to by a union representative.  This Court has required only that an agreement to arbitrate statutory antidiscrimination claims be \u201cexplicitly stated\u201d in the collective-bargaining agreement.  Wright, 525 U. S., at 80 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The CBA under review here meets that obligation.  Respondents incorrectly counter that an individual employee must personally \u201cwaive\u201d a \u201c[substantive] right\u201d to proceed in court for a waiver to be \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d under the ADEA.  29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7626(f)(1).  As explained below, however, the agreement to arbitrate ADEA claims is not the waiver of a \u201csubstantive right\u201d as that term is employed in the ADEA.  Wright, supra, at 80; see infra, at 15\u201316.  Indeed, if the \u201cright\u201d referred to in \u00a7626(f)(1) included the prospective waiver of the right to bring an ADEA claim in court, even a waiver signed by an individual employee would be invalid as the statute also prevents individuals from \u201cwaiv[ing] rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.\u201d  \u00a7626(f)(1)(C).[Footnote 6]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examination of the two federal statutes at issue in this case, therefore, yields a straightforward answer to the question presented: The NLRA provided the Union and the RAB with statutory authority to collectively bargain for arbitration of workplace discrimination claims, and Congress did not terminate that authority with respect to federal age-discrimination claims in the ADEA.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this appeal.  Congress has chosen to allow arbitration of ADEA claims.  The Judiciary must respect that choice.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the Gardner-Denver line of cases.  Respondents interpret Gardner-Denver and its progeny to hold that \u201ca union cannot waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum under the federal antidiscrimination statutes\u201d because \u201callowing the union to waive this right would substitute the union\u2019s interests for the employee\u2019s antidiscrimination rights.\u201d  Brief for Respondents 12.  The \u201ccombination of union control over the process and inherent conflict of interest with respect to discrimination claims,\u201d they argue, \u201cprovided the foundation for the Court\u2019s holding [in Gardner-Denver] that arbitration under a collective-bargaining agreement could not preclude an individual employee\u2019s right to bring a lawsuit in court to vindicate a statutory discrimination claim.\u201d  Id., at 15.  We disagree.\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The holding of Gardner-Denver is not as broad as respondents suggest.  The employee in that case was covered by a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited \u201cdiscrimination against any employee on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry\u201d and that guaranteed that \u201c[n]o employee will be discharged \u2026 except for just cause.\u201d 415 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The agreement also included a \u201cmultistep grievance procedure\u201d that culminated in compulsory arbitration for any \u201cdifferences aris[ing] between the Company and the Union as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement\u201d and \u201cany trouble aris[ing] in the plant.\u201d  Id., at 40\u201341 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The employee was discharged for allegedly producing too many defective parts while working for the respondent as a drill operator.  He filed a grievance with his union claiming that he was \u201c\u00a0\u2018unjustly discharged\u2019\u00a0\u201d in violation of the \u201c\u00a0\u2018just cause\u2019\u00a0\u201d provision within the CBA.  Then at the final prearbitration step of the grievance process, the employee added a claim that he was discharged because of his race.  Id., at 38\u201342.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arbitrator ultimately ruled that the employee had been \u201c\u00a0\u2018discharged for just cause,\u2019\u00a0\u201d but \u201cmade no reference to [the] claim of racial discrimination.\u201d  Id., at 42.  After obtaining a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, the employee filed a claim in Federal District Court, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court issued a decision, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which granted summary judgment to the employer because it concluded that \u201cthe claim of racial discrimination had been submitted to the arbitrator and resolved adversely to [the employee].\u201d  Id., at 43.  In the District Court\u2019s view, \u201chaving voluntarily elected to pursue his grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of the collective-bargaining agreement,\u201d the employee was \u201cbound by the arbitral decision\u201d and precluded from suing his employer on any other grounds, such as a statutory claim under Title VII.  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court reversed the judgment on the narrow ground that the arbitration was not preclusive because the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.  As a result, the lower courts erred in relying on the \u201cdoctrine of election of remedies\u201d to bar the employee\u2019s Title VII claim.  Id., at 49.  \u201cThat doctrine, which refers to situations where an individual pursues remedies that are legally or factually inconsistent\u201d with each other, did not apply to the employee\u2019s dual pursuit of arbitration and a Title VII discrimination claim in district court.  The employee\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement did not mandate arbitration of statutory antidiscrimination claims.  Id., at 49\u201350.  \u201cAs the proctor of the bargain, the arbitrator\u2019s task is to effectuate the intent of the parties.\u201d  Id., at 53.  Because the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator \u201cauthority to resolve only questions of contractual rights,\u201d his decision could not prevent the employee from bringing the Title VII claim in federal court \u201cregardless of whether certain contractual rights are similar to, or duplicative of, the substantive rights secured by Title VII.\u201d  Id., at 53\u201354; see also id., at 50.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also explained that the employee had not waived his right to pursue his Title VII claim in federal court by participating in an arbitration that was premised on the same underlying facts as the Title VII claim.  See id., at 52.  Thus, whether the legal theory of preclusion advanced by the employer rested on \u201cthe doctrines of election of remedies\u201d or was recast \u201cas resting instead on the doctrine of equitable estoppel and on themes of res judicata and collateral estoppel,\u201d id., at 49, n.\u00a010 (internal quotation marks omitted), it could not prevail in light of the collective-bargaining agreement\u2019s failure to address arbitration of Title VII claims.  See id., at 46, n.\u00a06 (\u201c[W]e hold that the federal policy favoring arbitration does not establish that an arbitrator\u2019s resolution of a contractual claim is dispositive of a statutory claim under Title VII\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s decisions following Gardner-Denver have not broadened its holding to make it applicable to the facts of this case.  In Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728 (1981), the Court considered \u201cwhether an employee may bring an action in federal district court, alleging a violation of the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, \u2026 after having unsuccessfully submitted a wage claim based on the same underlying facts to a joint grievance committee pursuant to the provisions of his union\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d  Id., at 729\u2013730.  The Court held that the unsuccessful arbitration did not preclude the federal lawsuit.  Like the collective-bargaining agreement in Gardner-Denver, the arbitration provision under review in Barrentine did not expressly reference the statutory claim at issue.  See 450 U. S., at 731, n.\u00a05.  The Court thus reiterated that an \u201carbitrator\u2019s power is both derived from, and limited by, the collective-bargaining agreement\u201d and \u201c[h]is task is limited to construing the meaning of the collective-bargaining agreement so as to effectuate the collective intent of the parties.\u201d  Id., at 744.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284 (1984), was decided along similar lines.  The question presented in that case was \u201cwhether a federal court may accord preclusive effect to an unappealed arbitration award in a case brought under [42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983].\u201d  Id., at 285.  The Court declined to fashion such a rule, again explaining that \u201cbecause an arbitrator\u2019s authority derives solely from the contract, Barrentine, supra, at 744, an arbitrator may not have authority to enforce \u00a71983\u201d when that provision is left unaddressed by the arbitration agreement.  Id., at 290.  Accordingly, as in both Gardner-Denver and Barrentine, the Court\u2019s decision in McDonald hinged on the scope of the collective-bargaining agreement and the arbitrator\u2019s parallel mandate.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts underlying Gardner-Denver, Barrentine, and McDonald reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule arising from that trilogy of decisions.  Summarizing those opinions in Gilmer, this Court made clear that the Gardner-Denver line of cases \u201cdid not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims.\u201d  500 U. S., at 35.  Those decisions instead \u201cinvolved the quite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.  Since the employees there had not agreed to arbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators were not authorized to resolve such claims, the arbitration in those cases understandably was held not to preclude subsequent statutory actions.\u201d  Ibid.; see also Wright, 525 U. S., at 76; Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 127, n.\u00a021 (1994).[Footnote 7]  Gardner-Denver and its progeny thus do not control the outcome where, as is the case here, the collective-bargaining agreement\u2019s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.[Footnote 8]\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that apart from their narrow holdings, the Gardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta that was highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination rights.  That skepticism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court in Gardner-Denver erroneously assumed that an agreement to submit statutory discrimination claims to arbitration was tantamount to a waiver of those rights.  See 415 U. S., at 51. (\u201c[T]here can be no prospective waiver of an employee\u2019s rights under Title VII\u201d (emphasis added)).  For this reason, the Court stated, \u201cthe rights conferred [by Title VII] can form no part of the collective-bargaining process since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind Title VII.\u201d  Ibid.; see also id., at 56 (\u201cwe have long recognized that \u2018the choice of forums inevitably affects the scope of the substantive right to be vindicated\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting U. S. Bulk Carriers, Inc. v. Arguelles, 400 U. S. 351, 359\u2013360 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring))).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court was correct in concluding that federal antidiscrimination rights may not be prospectively waived, see 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7626(f)(1)(C); see supra, at 9, but it confused an agreement to arbitrate those statutory claims with a prospective waiver of the substantive right.  The decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek relief from a court in the first instance.  See Gilmer, supra, at 26 (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[B]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 628)).  This \u201cCourt has been quite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can be enforced under the FAA without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protection against discrimination prohibited by federal law.\u201d  Circuit City Stores, Inc., 532 U. S., at 123. The suggestion in Gardner-Denver that the decision to arbitrate statutory discrimination claims was tantamount to a substantive waiver of those rights, therefore, reveals a distorted understanding of the compromise made when an employee agrees to compulsory arbitration.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this respect, Gardner-Denver is a direct descendant of the Court\u2019s decision in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953), which held that an agreement to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 was unenforceable.  See id., at 438.  The Court subsequently overruled Wilko and, in so doing, characterized the decision as \u201cpervaded by \u2026 \u2018the old judicial hostility to arbitration.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480 (1989).  The Court added: \u201cTo the extent that Wilko rested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants, it has fallen far out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes.\u201d  Id., at 481; see also Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 626\u2013627 (\u201c[W]e are well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desirability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral tribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution\u201d).  The timeworn \u201cmistrust of the arbitral process\u201d harbored by the Court in Gardner-Denver thus weighs against reliance on anything more than its core holding.  Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231\u2013232 (1987); see also Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 34, n.\u00a05 (reiterating that Gardner-Denver\u2019s view of arbitration \u201chas been undermined by [the Court\u2019s] recent arbitration decisions\u201d).  Indeed, in light of the \u201cradical change, over two decades, in the Court\u2019s receptivity to arbitration,\u201d Wright, 525 U. S., at 77, reliance on any judicial decision similarly littered with Wilko\u2019s overt hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements would be ill advised. [Footnote 9]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Gardner-Denver mistakenly suggested that certain features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited to the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca comparatively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of rights created by Title VII.\u201d  415 U. S., at 56.  According to the Court, the \u201cfactfinding process in arbitration\u201d is \u201cnot equivalent to judicial factfinding\u201d and the \u201cinformality of arbitral procedure \u2026 makes arbitration a less appropriate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the federal courts.\u201d  Id., at 57, 58.  The Court also questioned the competence of arbitrators to decide federal statutory claims.  See id., at 57 (\u201c[T]he specialized competence of arbitrators pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land\u201d); Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 743 (\u201cAlthough an arbitrator may be competent to resolve many preliminary factual questions, such as whether the employee \u2018punched in\u2019 when he said he did, he may lack competence to decide the ultimate legal issue whether an employee\u2019s right to a minimum wage or to overtime pay under the statute has been violated\u201d).  In the Court\u2019s view, \u201cthe resolution of statutory or constitutional issues is a primary responsibility of courts, and judicial construction has proved especially necessary with respect to Title VII, whose broad language frequently can be given meaning only by reference to public law concepts.\u201d  Gardner-Denver, supra, at 57; see also McDonald, 466 U. S., at 290 (\u201cAn arbitrator may not \u2026 have the expertise required to resolve the complex legal questions that arise in \u00a71983 actions\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These misconceptions have been corrected.  For example, the Court has \u201crecognized that arbitral tribunals are readily capable of handling the factual and legal complexities of antitrust claims, notwithstanding the absence of judicial instruction and supervision\u201d and that \u201cthere is no reason to assume at the outset that arbitrators will not follow the law.\u201d  McMahon, supra, at 232; Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 634 (\u201cWe decline to indulge the presumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting a proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain competent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators\u201d).  An arbitrator\u2019s capacity to resolve complex questions of fact and law extends with equal force to discrimination claims brought under the ADEA.  Moreover, the recognition that arbitration procedures are more streamlined than federal litigation is not a basis for finding the forum somehow inadequate; the relative informality of arbitration is one of the chief reasons that parties select arbitration.  Parties \u201ctrad[e] the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration.\u201d  Id., at 628.  In any event, \u201c[i]t is unlikely \u2026 that age discrimination claims require more extensive discovery than other claims that we have found to be arbitrable, such as RICO and antitrust claims.\u201d  Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 31.  At bottom, objections centered on the nature of arbitration do not offer a credible basis for discrediting the choice of that forum to resolve statutory antidiscrimination claims.[Footnote 10]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the Court in Gardner-Denver raised in a footnote a \u201cfurther concern\u201d regarding \u201cthe union\u2019s exclusive control over the manner and extent to which an individual grievance is presented.\u201d  415 U. S., at 58, n.\u00a019.  The Court suggested that in arbitration, as in the collective-bargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in the bargaining unit.  Ibid.; see also McDonald, supra, at 291 (\u201cThe union\u2019s interests and those of the individual employee are not always identical or even compatible.  As a result, the union may present the employee\u2019s grievance less vigorously, or make different strategic choices, than would the employee\u201d); see also Barrentine, supra, at 742; post, at 8, n.\u00a04 (Souter,\u00a0J., dissenting).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We cannot rely on this judicial policy concern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text.  Absent a constitutional barrier, \u201cit is not for us to substitute our view of \u2026 policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress.\u201d  Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress is fully equipped \u201cto identify any category of claims as to which agreements to arbitrate will be held unenforceable.\u201d  Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 627.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the Gardner-Denver dicta, and seized on by respondents here, there is \u201cno reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read\u201d simply because of an alleged conflict of interest between a union and its members.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 628.  This is a \u201cbattl[e] that should be fought among the political branches and the industry.  Those parties should not seek to amend the statute by appeal to the Judicial Branch.\u201d  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conflict-of-interest argument also proves too much. Labor unions certainly balance the economic interests of some employees against the needs of the larger work force as they negotiate collective-bargain agreements and implement them on a daily basis.  But this attribute of organized labor does not justify singling out an arbitration provision for disfavored treatment.  This \u201cprinciple of majority rule\u201d to which respondents object is in fact the central premise of the NLRA.  Emporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization, 420 U. S. 50, 62 (1975).  \u201cIn establishing a regime of majority rule, Congress sought to secure to all members of the unit the benefits of their collective strength and bargaining power, in full awareness that the superior strength of some individuals or groups might be subordinated to the interest of the majority.\u201d  Ibid. (footnote omitted); see also Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U. S. 330, 338 (1953) (\u201cThe complete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected\u201d); Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Rychlik, 352 U. S. 480, 498 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  It was Congress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty that this system necessarily demands.  Respondents\u2019 argument that they were deprived of the right to pursue their ADEA claims in federal court by a labor union with a conflict of interest is therefore unsustainable; it amounts to a collateral attack on the NLRA.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, Congress has accounted for this conflict of interest in several ways.  As indicated above, the NLRA has been interpreted to impose a \u201cduty of fair representation\u201d on labor unions, which a union breaches \u201cwhen its conduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d  Marquez v. Screen Actors, 525 U. S. 33, 44 (1998).  This duty extends to \u201cchallenges leveled not only at a union\u2019s contract administration and enforcement efforts but at its negotiation activities as well.\u201d  Beck, 487 U. S., at 743 (citation omitted). Thus, a union is subject to liability under the NLRA if it illegally discriminates against older workers in either the formation or governance of the collective-bargaining agreement, such as by deciding not to pursue a grievance on behalf of one of its members for discriminatory reasons.  See Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, 177 (1967) (describing the duty of fair representation as the \u201cstatutory obligation to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct\u201d (emphasis added)).  Respondents in fact brought a fair representation suit against the Union based on its withdrawal of support for their age-discrimination claims.  See n.\u00a02, supra.  Given this avenue that Congress has made available to redress a union\u2019s violation of its duty to its members, it is particularly inappropriate to ask this Court to impose an artificial limitation on the collective-bargaining process.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, a union is subject to liability under the ADEA if the union itself discriminates against its members on the basis of age.  See 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7623(d); see also 1 B.\u00a0Lindemann & P.\u00a0Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1575\u20131581 (4th ed. 2007) (explaining that a labor union may be held jointly liable with an employer under federal antidiscrimination laws for discriminating in the formation of a collective-bargaining agreement, knowingly acquiescing in the employer\u2019s discrimination, or inducing the employer to discriminate); cf. Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 669 (1987).  Union members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the National Labor Relations Board, which may then seek judicial intervention under this Court\u2019s precedent.  See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 295\u2013296 (2002).  In sum, Congress has provided remedies for the situation where a labor union is less than vigorous in defense of its members\u2019 claims of discrimination under the ADEA.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, respondents offer a series of arguments contending that the particular CBA at issue here does not clearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims.  See Brief for Respondents 44\u201347.  But respondents did not raise these contract-based arguments in the District Court or the Court of Appeals.  To the contrary, respondents acknowledged on appeal that the CBA provision requiring arbitration of their federal antidiscrimination statutory claims \u201cis sufficiently explicit\u201d in precluding their federal lawsuit.  Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellees in No. 06\u20133047\u2013cv(L) etc. (CA2), p.\u00a09.  In light of respondents\u2019 litigating position, both lower courts assumed that the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause clearly applied to respondents and proceeded to decide the question left unresolved in Wright.  We granted review of the question presented on that understanding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWithout cross-petitioning for certiorari, a prevailing party may, of course, \u2018defend its judgment on any ground properly raised below whether or not that ground was relied upon, rejected, or even considered by the District Court or the Court of Appeals.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, 38\u201339 (1989) (quoting Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n.\u00a020 (1979)).  But this Court will affirm on grounds that have \u201c\u00a0\u2018not been raised below \u2026 \u201conly in exceptional cases.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Nordberg, supra, at 39 (quoting Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468\u2013469, n.\u00a012 (1983)).  This is not an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d  As a result, we find that respondents\u2019 alternative arguments for affirmance have been forfeited.  See, e.g., Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 360 (2007); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 56, n.\u00a04 (2002).  We will not resurrect them on respondents\u2019 behalf.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents also argue that the CBA operates as a substantive waiver of their ADEA rights because it not only precludes a federal lawsuit, but also allows the Union to block arbitration of these claims.  Brief for Respondents 28\u201330.  Petitioners contest this characterization of the CBA, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 23\u201327, and offer record evidence suggesting that the Union has allowed respondents to continue with the arbitration even though the Union has declined to participate, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  But not only does this question require resolution of contested factual allegations, it was not fully briefed to this or any court and is not fairly encompassed within the question presented, see this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a).  Thus, although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be upheld, see Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 637, and n.\u00a019; Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 29, we are not positioned to resolve in the first instance whether the CBA allows the Union to prevent respondents from \u201ceffectively vindicating\u201d their \u201cfederal statutory rights in the arbitral forum,\u201d Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79, 90 (2000).  Resolution of this question at this juncture would be particularly inappropriate in light of our hesitation to invalidate arbitration agreements on the basis of speculation.  See id., at 91.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0Article V establishes the grievance process, which applies to all claims regardless of whether they are subject to arbitration under the CBA.  Article VI establishes the procedures for arbitration and postarbitration judicial review, and, in particular, provides that the arbitrator \u201cshall \u2026 decide all differences arising between the parties as to interpretation, application or performance of any part of this Agreement and such other issues as the parties are expressly required to arbitrate before him under the terms of this Agreement.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a\u201347a.\n\u00a0Respondents also filed a \u201chybrid\u201d lawsuit against the Union and petitioners under \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7185, see also DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, 164\u2013165 (1983), alleging that the Union breached its \u201cduty of fair representation\u201d under the NLRA by withdrawing support for the age-discrimination claims during the arbitration and that petitioners breached the CBA by reassigning respondents.  Respondents later voluntarily dismissed this suit with prejudice. \n\u00a0Petitioners also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that respondents had sufficiently alleged an ADEA claim by claiming that they \u201cwere over the age of 40, \u2026 they were reassigned to positions which led to substantial losses in income, and \u2026 their replacements were both younger and had less seniority at the building.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a (footnote omitted).  Petitioners have not appealed that ruling. \n\u00a0Compare, e.g., Rogers v. New York Univ., 220 F.\u00a03d 73, 75 (CA2 2000) (per curiam); O\u2019Brien v. Agawam, 350 F.\u00a03d 279, 285 (CA1 2003); Mitchell v. Chapman, 343 F.\u00a03d 811, 824 (CA6 2003); Tice v. American Airlines, Inc., 288 F.\u00a03d 313, 317 (CA7 2002), with, e.g., Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Massey, 373 F.\u00a03d 530, 533 (CA4 2004).\n\u00a0Justice Souter claims that this understanding is \u201cimpossible to square with our conclusion in [Alexander v.] Gardner-Denver [Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974)] that \u2018Title VII \u2026 stands on plainly different ground\u2019 from \u2018statutory rights related to collective activity\u2019: \u2018it concerns not majoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Post, at 5 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 51).  As explained below, however, Justice Souter repeats the key analytical mistake made in Gardner-Denver\u2019s dicta by equating the decision to arbitrate Title VII and ADEA claims to a decision to forgo these substantive guarantees against workplace discrimination.  See infra, at 15\u201317.  The right to a judicial forum is not the nonwaivable \u201csubstantive\u201d right protected by the ADEA.  See infra, at 9, 24.  Thus, although Title VII and ADEA rights may well stand on \u201cdifferent ground\u201d than statutory rights that protect \u201cmajoritarian processes,\u201d Gardner-Denver, supra, at 51, the voluntary decision to collectively bargain for arbitration does not deny those statutory antidiscrimination rights the full protection they are due.\n\u00a0Respondents\u2019 contention that \u00a7118 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102\u2013166, 105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71981 (2000 ed.), precludes the enforcement of this arbitration agreement also is misplaced.  See Brief for Respondents 31\u201332; see also post, at 8\u20139 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Section 118 expresses Congress\u2019 support for alternative dispute resolution: \u201cWhere appropriate and to the extent authorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, including \u2026 arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under\u201d the ADEA.  105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S.C. \u00a71981.  Respondents argue that the legislative history actually signals Congress\u2019 intent to preclude arbitration waivers in the collective-bargaining context.  In particular, respondents point to a House Report that, in spite of the statute\u2019s plain language, interprets \u00a7118 to support their position.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p.\u00a097 (1991) (\u201c[A]ny agreement to submit disputed issues to arbitration \u2026 in the context of a collective bargaining agreement \u2026 does not preclude the affected person from seeking relief under the enforcement provisions of Title VII.  This view is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974)\u201d).  But the legislative history mischaracterizes the holding of Gardner-Denver, which does not prohibit collective bargaining for arbitration of ADEA claims.  See infra, at 11\u201314.  Moreover, reading the legislative history in the manner suggested by respondents would create a direct conflict with the statutory text, which encourages the use of arbitration for dispute resolution without imposing any constraints on collective bargaining.  In such a contest, the text must prevail.  See Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 147\u2013148 (1994) (\u201c[W]e do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear\u201d).\n\u00a0Justice Souter\u2019s reliance on Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525 U. S. 70 (1998), to support its view of Gardner-Denver is misplaced.  See post, at 5, 7.  Wright identified the \u201ctension\u201d between the two lines of cases represented by Gardner-Denver and Gilmer, but found \u201cit unnecessary to resolve the question of the validity of a union-negotiated waiver, since it [was] apparent \u2026 on the facts and arguments presented \u2026 that no such waiver [had] occurred.\u201d  525 U. S., at 76\u201377.  And although his dissent describes Wright\u2019s characterization of Gardner-Denver as \u201craising a \u2018seemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights,\u2019\u00a0\u201d post, at 7 (quoting Wright, 525 U. S., at 80), it wrenches the statement out of context: \u201cAlthough [the right to a judicial forum] is not a substantive right, see Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 26, and whether or not Gardner-Denver\u2019s seemingly absolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights survives Gilmer, Gardner-Denver at least stands for the proposition that the right to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected against less-than-explicit union waiver in a CBA,\u201d id., at 80 (emphasis added).  Wright therefore neither endorsed Gardner-Denver\u2019s broad language nor suggested a particular result in this case.\n\u00a0Because today\u2019s decision does not contradict the holding of Gardner-Denver, we need not resolve the stare decisis concerns raised by the dissenting opinions.  See post, at 4, 9 (opinion of Souter, J.); post, at 2\u20134 (opinion of Stevens, J.). But given the development of this Court\u2019s arbitration jurisprudence in the intervening years, see infra, at 16\u201319, Gardner-Denver would appear to be a strong candidate for overruling if the dissents\u2019 broad view of its holding, see post, at 6\u20137 (opinion of Souter,\u00a0J.), were correct.  See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989) (explaining that it is appropriate to overrule a decision where there \u201chas been [an] intervening development of the law\u201d such that the earlier \u201cdecision [is] irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines and policies\u201d).\n\u00a0Justice Stevens suggests that the Court is displacing its \u201cearlier determination of the relevant provisions\u2019 meaning\u201d based on a \u201cpreference for arbitration.\u201d  Post, at 2.  But his criticism lacks any basis.  We are not revisiting a settled issue or disregarding an earlier determination; the Court is simply deciding the question identified in Wright as unresolved.  See supra, at 5\u20136; see also infra, at 23\u201324. And, contrary to Justice Stevens\u2019 accusation, it is the Court\u2019s fidelity to the ADEA\u2019s text\u2014not an alleged preference for arbitration\u2014that dictates the answer to the question presented.  As Gilmer explained, nothing in the text of Title VII or the ADEA precludes contractual arbitration, see supra, at 8\u20139, and Justice Stevens has never suggested otherwise.  Rather, he has always contended that permitting the \u201ccompulsory arbitration\u201d of employment discrimination claims conflicts with his perception of \u201cthe congressional purpose animating the ADEA.\u201d  Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 41 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see also id., at 42 (\u201cPlainly, it would not comport with the congressional objectives behind a statute seeking to enforce civil rights protected by Title VII to allow the very forces that had practiced discrimination to contract away the right to enforce civil rights in the courts\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Gilmer Court did not adopt Justice Stevens\u2019 personal view of the purposes underlying the ADEA, for good reason: That view is not embodied within the statute\u2019s text.  Accordingly, it is not the statutory text that Justice Stevens has sought to vindicate\u2014it is instead his own \u201cpreference\u201d for mandatory judicial review, which he disguises as a search for congressional purpose.  This Court is not empowered to incorporate such a preference into the text of a federal statute.  See infra, at 20\u201321.  It is for this reason, and not because of a \u201cpolicy favoring arbitration,\u201d see post, at 1, 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), that the Court overturned Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953).  And it is why we disavow the antiarbitration dicta of Gardner-Denver and its progeny today.\n\u00a0Moreover, an arbitrator\u2019s decision as to whether a unionized employee has been discriminated against on the basis of age in violation of the ADEA remains subject to judicial review under the FAA.  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a710(a).  \u201c[A]lthough judicial scrutiny of arbitration awards necessarily is limited, such review is sufficient to ensure that arbitrators comply with the requirements of the statute.\u201d  Shearson/American Express Inc. v.

The Task Force, based on evidence that Callahan was a methamphetamine dealer, had sent an informant to his home to make a purchase. After receiving a signal from the informant that the sale had taken place, the Task Force entered the home and conducted a protective sweep of the house without a warrant but after getting Callahan's consent. At trial, Callahan was convicted of possessing and distributing methamphetamines based on evidence discovered during the search, however the Utah Court of Appeals held the evidence inadmissible and reversed Callahan's conviction.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Callahan filed this action in federal court against the Task Force and individual officers alleging that the search violated his civil rights under the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah dismissed his claim, holding in part that the \"consent once removed\" doctrine applied to the search. Under the doctrine, an undercover officer may summon backup officers into a home after that officer has been invited with consent. However the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit disagreed, holding that the doctrine does not apply when the officers are summoned by a police informant. Therefore, according to the Tenth Circuit, Callahan had established a violation of his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1)Does a police entry following an informant's signal of probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment under the consent once removed doctrine?</p>\n<p>2)Was it clearly established at the time of entry in this case that the consent once removed doctrine violated the Fourth Amendment?</p>\n<p>3)Should the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Saucier v. Katz</em> be overturned?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not addressed, no, and yes. In a unanimous decision written by Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court held that it was not clearly established at the time of police entry that the consent once removed doctrine violated the Fourth Amendment and therefore that the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force was qualifiedly immune in its search of Mr. Callahan's home. The Court also overturned its prior decision in <em>Saucier v. Katz</em>, which prescribed a rigid two-part inquiry into government officials' qualified immunity claims: \"1) whether the facts alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right, and 2) if so, whether that right was clearly established at the time of the defendant's alleged misconduct.\" Rather, the Court held that this inquiry should be utilized at the discretion of the lower courts. It reasoned that substantial judicial resources were often expended in determining difficult constitutional claims that ultimately had little to do with the outcome of the case.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 38350, "name": "Peter Stirba", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/peter_stirba", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Stirba", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "peter_stirba"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioners", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19669"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 36722, "name": "Malcolm L.

Iraq moved to dismiss arguing that Section 1605(f) provides a limitations period of ten years for any action filed under Section 1605(a)(7). The district court agreed and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p>After the plaintiffs' appeal, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which revised Section 1605(a)(7) granting the President authority to waive the exception to the FSIA with respect to Iraq, which he did. Iraq subsequently contended that because of the revision, the case should be dismissed. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed and reversed the district court. It held that the district court had jurisdiction.

The groups felt the exercises would cause serious harm to various species of marine mammal present in the southern California waters. The groups sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Navy from carrying out the exercises. The district court granted the injunction, finding that the NRDC had demonstrated probable success on its claim that the Navy had violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) regarding the exercises. The district court also denied the efforts of the Council on Environmental Quality to provide \"alternative arrangements\" for the Navy to proceed without an EIS. The district court stated that such arrangements require \"emergency circumstances\" not applicable to the case</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court and upheld the decision granting the injunction. The court reviewed the findings under an \"abuse of discretion\" standard and determined that the district court had not abused its discretion in finding that the environmental groups raised substantial questions as to whether the exercises would have a significant impact on the environment and that these claims were likely to succeed on the merits. Furthermore, the district court had acted properly when it found that allowing long-planned, routine training exercises to meet the \"emergency circumstances\" exception would create an unacceptably broad definition of that phrase.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Can federal courts grant preliminary injunctions on Naval training exercises based on the possible negative environmental impact of those exercises when the Navy fails to complete an Environmental Impact Statement as required by the National Environmental Policy Act?</p>\n<p>What circumstances are necessary to allow the Navy to conduct exercises without an Environmental Impact Statement under the \"emergency circumstances\" exception of the National Environmental Policy Act?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No and not specifically determined. The Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision authored by Chief Justice John G. Roberts that the standard for properly granting a preliminary injunction is not based on the \"possibility\" of irreparable harm to marine life, but rather that \"irreparable injury is likely\" in the absence of such an injunction. Regardless, the Court reasoned that in this case the public interest in conducting naval training exercises outweighed even certain irreparable harm to marine life. Therefore, the Court reversed the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and removed the preliminary injunction against the Navy's training exercises. It further instructed that if a district court finds the Navy must complete an Environmental Impact Statement, it need find alternative ways to persuade the Navy to comply, other than through an injunction.</p>\n<p>Justice Stepehen G. Breyer filed a separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part. While agreeing with much of the majority's reasoning, he advocated keeping in place the court of appeals' modified injunction against naval exercises, at least until Navy's publication of an acceptable Environmental Impact Statement. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg joined by Justice David H. Souter dissented finding that the District Court appropriately used its discretion to order a preliminary injunction against the Navy.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25346, "name": "Gregory G.

In 2004, the Office of Administrative Hearings for the State of Oregon determined that T.A. was disabled and eligible for special education under the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As T.A. was no longer enrolled in the Forest Grove School District, but attending private school, the hearing officer ordered the school district to reimburse T.A. for the private school tuition ($5,200 per month), determining it had failed to offer him a free and appropriate public education.</p>\n<p>The school district appealed the order in an Oregon federal district court arguing that reimbursement was not appropriate because T.A. unilaterally withdrew from school, never received special education services while enrolled, and withdrew for reasons unrelated to his learning disability. The district court invalidated the order. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court and upheld the order. It reasoned that IDEA provided the courts broad discretion in order to achieve \"equitable relief\" for disabled students, including reimbursement for private school tuition.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Under IDEA, can a federal district court order a school district to reimburse its former student for his tuition at a private school when the student unilaterally withdrew from school, never received special education services while enrolled, and withdrew for reasons unrelated to his learning disability?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that IDEA authorizes reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide free appropriate public education (FAPE) and the private school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education services through the public school. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court relied on its decisions in <em>Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass.</em> and <em>Florence County School Dist. 4 v. Carter</em> to reach its conclusion. There, the Court had found that courts had the power to reimburse parents for private school tuition when a school district fails to provide FAPE and a private school placement is appropriate.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter dissented and was joined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia and Clarence Thomas. He argued that the 1997 Congressional amendments to IDEA limited reimbursement for private school tuition when the public school had provided FAPE and the student's withdrawal was unilateral, and then criticized the majority for not recognizing such limitations.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25278, "name": "Gary S.

Vessels subject to taxation elsewhere were held to an apportionment formula based on the number of days spent there. In response, Polar Tankers Inc. filed suit in an Alaska trial court arguing that the apportionment provision was unconstitutional. The trial court in part agreed, ruling that the apportionment method violated the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, but did not violate the Tonnage Clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Supreme Court of Alaska reversed in part. The court held that the tax apportionment formula used by the city of Alaska was fair and non-duplicative. Therefore, it did not violate the Due Process, Commerce, or Tonnage Clauses in the Constitution.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Does a municipal property tax that falls exclusively on large vessels and uses an apportionment method for out of state vessels violate the Due Process Clause of the Constitution?</p>\n<p>2) Does it violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution?</p>\n<p>3) Does it violate the Tonnage Clause of the Constitution?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not answered, not answered, yes. The Supreme Court held that the Valdez, Alaska property tax that fell exclusively on large vessels and that used an apportionment method for out of state vessels violated the Tonnage Clause of the Constitution. With Justice Stephen G. Breyer writing for the majority and joined in part by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reiterated that the Tonnage Clause need be interpreted in light of its purpose of restraining states from enacting taxes that injure the interests of other states. Here, the Court reasoned that the Valdez tax that targeted ships not residing in Alaska did just this, and therefore was unconstitutional. Moreover, the Court acknowledged that the Tonnage Clause would not have applied to the City of Valdez had it imposed similar taxes upon other businesses. However, the Court found little evidence that Valdez did so, and therefore the tax was not excluded from the scope of the Tonnage Clause.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. He agreed that the City of Valdez's tax was unconstitutional, but disagreed with the majority that an unconstitutional tax could become permissible when bundled with other similar taxes on other businesses and properties. Justice Alito also wrote separately, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice David H. Souter, dissented. He argued that the Tonnage Clause merely limits states from charging ships for \"the privilege of arriving and departing from a port.\" He reasoned that the City of Valdez tax did not do so and therefore the tax was not unconstitutional.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 19917, "name": "Charles A.

In February 2002, he was charged with the possession of unauthorized or counterfeit credit card numbers and with the intent to defraud. In January 2003, he was additionally charged with making a false statement to the FBI, making a false statement on a bank application, and using another person's identification for the purpose of influencing the action of a federally insured financial institution. Mr. Al- Marri pleaded not guilty to all counts. Just before trial, the government moved to dismiss its criminal charges against him and by order of the President designated Mr. Al-Marri an \"enemy combatant\". Thereafter, he has been held without charge in military custody.</p>\n<p>Mr. Al-Marri was denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by the federal district court in South Carolina. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered that his military detention cease. The court subsequently vacated this judgment and reconsidered the case en banc. It held in a 5-4 decision that if the government's allegations about Mr. Al-Marri are true then Congress by the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) has provided the President the power to detain him as an enemy combatant. But, in another 5-4 vote, it held that assuming the President is empowered to detain Mr. Al Marri as an enemy combatant, he was not afforded sufficient due process to challenge his detention. It remanded the case to the district court for further fact finding.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Does the Authorization for Use of Military Force empower the President to indefinitely detain lawful residents of the United States without criminal charge or trial based on government assertions that the detainee conspired with Al-Quaeda to engage in terrorist activities?</p>\n<p>2) Does the Constitution allow the indefinite detention of lawful residents of the United States without criminal charge or trial?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Unanswered.

Massey Coal Co., Inc. (Massey) for tortious interference, fraudulent misrepresentation, and fraudulent concealment. A state trial court in West Virginia rendered judgment against Massey and found it liable for $50 million in damages. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia granted review. However, prior to hearing, Mr. Caperton motioned for Justice Brent Benjamin to recuse himself. He argued that since Massey's C.E.O. had donated $3 million to Justice Benjamin's campaign to win a seat on the Supreme Court of Appeals, Justice Benjamin's participation would present a \"constitutionally unacceptable appearance of impropriety.\" The motion was denied. In a 3-2 decision with Justice Benjamin voting in the majority, the Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and ordered it to dismiss the case. After its decision, the court granted Mr. Caperton's motion for rehearing, but once again denied his motion for Justice Benjamin to recuse himself. On rehearing, the court maintained in a 3-2 decision that the trial court should be reversed and the case dismissed. It reasoned that a forum selection clause in a contract between the parties made the trial court in West Virginia an improper venue. It also concluded that because the parties had previously adjudicated the dispute in a Virginia state trial court, the doctrine of res judicata did not allow this case to be retried.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did Justice Brent Benjamin's failure to recuse himself from participation in a case where one of the parties donated $3 million to his election campaign violate the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that due process required that Justice Brent Benjamin recuse himself from participation in the case in question. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court stated that it need not find that Justice Benjamin was actually biased in his decision making in order to find invalid the decision in which he took part. Rather, it need merely be shown that \"under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human weakness,\" Justice Benjamin's interest posed \"a risk of actual bias\" and thus he should have recused himself if his participation threatened the adequate implementation of due process. The Court stated that such a risk of bias exists where a judge has a \"direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest,\" as Justice Benjamin did. Therefore, the Court reasoned, he improperly failed to recuse himself.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts dissented and was joined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito. He argued that the majority imprudently expanded the standard for which a judge need recuse himself by merely showing a \"probability of bias.\" He raised forty points of uncertainty that arise because of the majority's vague standard. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate dissenting opinion. He argued that the majority performed its duties poorly as a clarifying body by making an area of the law vastly more uncertain.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 43165, "name": "Theodore B.

The Court appointed a \"Special Master\" to investigate the allegations and to make recommendations to the Court. The Special Master submitted his report in 1994, finding that Colorado had indeed violated the Compact.</p>\n<p>Since 1994, the Special Master has issued three more reports. These reports have been accompanied by several objections by both states. The Court has dismissed the majority of these objections. The question presently before the Court is whether or not to overrule two of Kansas' objections to the most recent report of the Special Master.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Should expert witness attendance fees available in cases brought before the Supreme Court be the same as those available in the federal district courts?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes.

One of these men, Javaid Iqbal, was classified as being a \"high interest\" detainee at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. Iqbal claims that during his detention he was segregated from the rest of the prison population and mistreated in several ways, including confinement to a cell for 23 hours a day where he had blinding light shone on him constantly and air conditioning pumped into the cell even during the winter months. After being released, Iqbal brought a suit against representatives of the Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, and FBI alleging 21 violations of his statutory and constitutional rights based on his treatment while confined. These defendants argued that they should be protected from the suit in their official governmental roles through qualified immunity. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York denied the defendants' motion to dismiss and rejected the qualified immunity defense.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on all counts but one for violation of the right to due process. The Second Circuit noted that the actions taken by the government occurred in the immediate aftermath of September 11th and therefore created a unique context in which Iqbal's claims had to be reviewed. Even with these circumstances, however, the court felt that the qualified immunity defense could protect the government only from the due process claim. The \"serious allegations of gross mistreatment\" were enough to sustain the remaining counts.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Are governmental officers acting in their official capacities protected by the defense of qualified immunity in a claim brought by a former prison inmate, arrested in the immediate aftermath of September 11, alleging gross treatment and violations of his constitutional rights while confined?</p>\n<p>2) Are conclusory allegations that high-ranking government officers knew of or condoned allegedly unconstitutional acts by subordinate officials sufficient to state a claim for unlawful discrimination?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not Answered and No. The Supreme Court held that the Second Circuit had jurisdiction to affirm the district court's order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss Mr. Iqbal's claim. However, the Court also held that Mr. Iqbal failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for unlawful discrimination. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that Mr. Iqbal needed to plead sufficient facts to show that the defendants implemented their policies for the purpose of discrimination. Mr. Iqbal did not do this and thus his complaint was deficient. The Court remanded the case for the district court to determine whether Mr. Iqbal may amend his complaint.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer. He disagreed with the majority's opinion that Mr. Iqbal failed to state a claim. Rather, he argued that since the defendants admitted that they would be liable if they knew their subordinates' conduct was deliberately discriminatory, that Mr. Iqbal did plead sufficient facts to state a claim for unlawful discrimination.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25346, "name": "Gregory G.

As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and \u201cmindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,\u201d can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials.  See Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007).  A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow discovery related to higher level government officials.  See ibid.  Neither the briefs nor the Court\u2019s opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us.

Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), allows personal liability based on a federal officer\u2019s violation of an individual\u2019s rights under the First and Fifth Amendments, and it comes to us with the explicit concession of petitioners Ashcroft and Mueller that an officer may be subject to Bivens liability as a supervisor on grounds other than respondeat superior.  The Court apparently rejects this concession and, although it has no bearing on the majority\u2019s resolution of this case, does away with supervisory liability under Bivens.  The majority then misapplies the pleading standard under Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007), to conclude that the complaint fails to state a claim.  I respectfully dissent from both the rejection of supervisory liability as a cognizable claim in the face of petitioners\u2019 concession, and from the holding that the complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nI\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Iqbal was arrested in November 2001 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud in relation to identification documents, and was placed in pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.  Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.\u00a03d 143, 147\u2013148 (CA2 2007).  He alleges that FBI officials carried out a discriminatory policy by designating him as a person \u201c\u00a0\u2018of high interest\u2019\u00a0\u201d in the investigation of the September 11 attacks solely because of his race, religion, or national origin.  Owing to this designation he was placed in the detention center\u2019s Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit for over six months while awaiting the fraud trial.  Id., at 148.  As I will mention more fully below, Iqbal contends that Ashcroft and Mueller were at the very least aware of the discriminatory detention policy and condoned it (and perhaps even took part in devising it), thereby violating his First and Fifth Amendment rights.[Footnote 1]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Iqbal claims that on the day he was transferred to the special unit, prison guards, without provocation, \u201cpicked him up and threw him against the wall, kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across the room.\u201d  First Amended Complaint in No. 04\u2013CV\u20131809 (JG) (JA), \u00b6113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a (hereinafter Complaint).  He says that after being attacked a second time he sought medical attention but was denied care for two weeks.  Id., \u00b6\u00b6187\u2013188, at 189a.  According to Iqbal\u2019s complaint, prison staff in the special unit subjected him to unjustified strip and body cavity searches, id., \u00b6\u00b6136\u2013140, at 181a, verbally berated him as a \u201c\u00a0\u2018terrorist\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018Muslim killer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., \u00b687, at 170a\u2013171a, refused to give him adequate food, id., \u00b691, at 171a\u2013172a, and intentionally turned on air conditioning during the winter and heating during the summer, id., \u00b684, at 170a.  He claims that prison staff interfered with his attempts to pray and engage in religious study, id., \u00b6\u00b6153\u2013154, at 183a\u2013184a, and with his access to counsel, id., \u00b6\u00b6168, 171, at 186a\u2013187a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s motion to dismiss Iqbal\u2019s discrimination claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Ashcroft and Mueller then asked this Court to grant certiorari on two questions:\n\u201c1.\u2002Whether a conclusory allegation that a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts purportedly committed by subordinate officials is sufficient to state individual-capacity claims against those officials under Bivens.\n\n\n\u201c2.\u2002Whether a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official may be held personally liable for the allegedly unconstitutional acts of subordinate officials on the ground that, as high-level supervisors, they had constructive notice of the discrimination allegedly carried out by such subordinate officials.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. I.\n\nThe Court granted certiorari on both questions.  The first is about pleading; the second goes to the liability standard.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the first question, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask whether \u201ca cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official\u201d who \u201cknew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts committed by subordinate officials\u201d was subject to liability under Bivens.  In fact, they conceded in their petition for certiorari that they would be liable if they had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of discrimination by their subordinates and exhibited \u201c\u00a0\u2018deliberate indifference\u2019\u00a0\u201d to that discrimination.  Pet. for Cert. 29 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 837 (1994)).  Instead, they asked the Court to address whether Iqbal\u2019s allegations against them (which they call conclusory) were sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2), and in particular whether the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision in Twombly construing that rule.  Pet. for Cert. 11\u201324.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second question, Ashcroft and Mueller asked this Court to say whether they could be held personally liable for the actions of their subordinates based on the theory that they had constructive notice of their subordinates\u2019 unconstitutional conduct.  Id., at 25\u201333.  This was an odd question to pose, since Iqbal has never claimed that Ashcroft and Mueller are liable on a constructive notice theory.  Be that as it may, the second question challenged only one possible ground for imposing supervisory liability under Bivens.  In sum, both questions assumed that a defendant could raise a Bivens claim on theories of supervisory liability other than constructive notice, and neither question asked the parties or the Court to address the elements of such liability.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The briefing at the merits stage was no different.  Ashcroft and Mueller argued that the factual allegations in Iqbal\u2019s complaint were insufficient to overcome their claim of qualified immunity; they also contended that they could not be held liable on a theory of constructive notice.  Again they conceded, however, that they would be subject to supervisory liability if they \u201chad actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being \u2018of high interest\u2019 and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 50; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21\u201322.  Iqbal argued that the allegations in his complaint were sufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) and Twombly, and conceded that as a matter of law he could not recover under a theory of respondeat superior.  See Brief for Respondent Iqbal 46.  Thus, the parties agreed as to a proper standard of supervisory liability, and the disputed question was whether Iqbal\u2019s complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without acknowledging the parties\u2019 agreement as to the standard of supervisory liability, the Court asserts that it must sua sponte decide the scope of supervisory liability here.  Ante, at 11\u201313. I agree that, absent Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s concession, that determination would have to be made; without knowing the elements of a supervisory liability claim, there would be no way to determine whether a plaintiff had made factual allegations amounting to grounds for relief on that claim.  See Twombly, 550 U. S., at 557\u2013558.  But deciding the scope of supervisory Bivens liability in this case is uncalled for.  There are several reasons, starting with the position Ashcroft and Mueller have taken and following from it.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, Ashcroft and Mueller have, as noted, made the critical concession that a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a subordinate\u2019s unconstitutional conduct and deliberate indifference to that conduct are grounds for Bivens liability.  Iqbal seeks to recover on a theory that Ashcroft and Mueller at least knowingly acquiesced (and maybe more than acquiesced) in the discriminatory acts of their subordinates; if he can show this, he will satisfy Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s own test for supervisory liability.  See Farmer, supra, at 842 (explaining that a prison official acts with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d if \u201cthe official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d).  We do not normally override a party\u2019s concession, see, e.g., United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 855 (1996) (holding that \u201c[i]t would be inappropriate for us to [e]xamine in this case, without the benefit of the parties\u2019 briefing,\u201d an issue the Government had conceded), and doing so is especially inappropriate when, as here, the issue is unnecessary to decide the case, see infra, at 8.  I would therefore accept Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s concession for purposes of this case and proceed to consider whether the complaint alleges at least knowledge and deliberate indifference.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, because of the concession, we have received no briefing or argument on the proper scope of supervisory liability, much less the full-dress argument we normally require.  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 676\u2013677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  We consequently are in no position to decide the precise contours of supervisory liability here, this issue being a complicated one that has divided the Courts of Appeals.  See infra, at 7\u20138.  This Court recently remarked on the danger of \u201cbad decisionmaking\u201d when the briefing on a question is \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14), yet today the majority answers a question with no briefing at all.  The attendant risk of error is palpable.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court\u2019s approach is most unfair to Iqbal.  He was entitled to rely on Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s concession, both in their petition for certiorari and in their merits briefs, that they could be held liable on a theory of knowledge and deliberate indifference.  By overriding that concession, the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be heard on the question.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority, however, does ignore the concession.  According to the majority, because Iqbal concededly cannot recover on a theory of respondeat superior, it follows that he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory liability.  Ante, at 13.  The majority says that in a Bivens action, \u201cwhere masters do not answer for the torts of their servants,\u201d \u201cthe term \u2018supervisory liability\u2019 is a misnomer,\u201d and that \u201c[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.\u201d  Ibid.  Lest there be any mistake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the scope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating Bivens supervisory liability entirely.  The nature of a supervisory liability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under certain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates, and it is this very principle that the majority rejects.  Ante, at 19 (\u201c[P]etitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic\u201d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dangers of the majority\u2019s readiness to proceed without briefing and argument are apparent in its cursory analysis, which rests on the assumption that only two outcomes are possible here: respondeat superior liability, in which \u201can employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment,\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a72.04 (2005), or no supervisory liability at all.  The dichotomy is false.  Even if an employer is not liable for the actions of his employee solely because the employee was acting within the scope of employment, there still might be conditions to render a supervisor liable for the conduct of his subordinate.  See, e.g., Whitfield v. Mel\u00e9ndez-Rivera, 431 F.\u00a03d 1, 14 (CA1 2005) (distinguishing between respondeat superior liability and supervisory liability); Bennett v. Eastpointe, 410 F.\u00a03d 810, 818 (CA6 2005) (same); Richardson v. Goord, 347 F.\u00a03d 431, 435 (CA2 2003) (same); Hall v. Lombardi, 996 F.\u00a02d 954, 961 (CA8 1993) (same).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, there is quite a spectrum of possible tests for supervisory liability: it could be imposed where a supervisor has actual knowledge of a subordinate\u2019s constitutional violation and acquiesces, see, e.g., Baker v. Monroe Twp., 50 F.\u00a03d 1186, 1994 (CA3 1995); Woodward v. Worland, 977 F.\u00a02d 1392, 1400 (CA10 1992); or where supervisors \u201c\u00a0\u2018know about the conduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see,\u2019\u00a0\u201d International Action Center v. United States, 365 F.\u00a03d 20, 28 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.) (quoting Jones v. Chicago, 856 F.\u00a02d 985, 992 (CA7 1988) (Posner, J.)); or where the supervisor has no actual knowledge of the violation but was reckless in his supervision of the subordinate, see, e.g., Hall, supra, at 961; or where the supervisor was grossly negligent, see, e.g., Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.\u00a02d 881, 902 (CA1 1988).  I am unsure what the general test for supervisory liability should be, and in the absence of briefing and argument I am in no position to choose or devise one.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither is the majority, but what is most remarkable about its foray into supervisory liability is that its conclusion has no bearing on its resolution of the case.  The majority says that all of the allegations in the complaint that Ashcroft and Mueller authorized, condoned, or even were aware of their subordinates\u2019 discriminatory conduct are \u201cconclusory\u201d and therefore are \u201cnot entitled to be assumed true.\u201d  Ante, at 17. As I explain below, this conclusion is unsound, but on the majority\u2019s understanding of Rule 8(a)(2) pleading standards, even if the majority accepted Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s concession and asked whether the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge and deliberate indifference, it presumably would still conclude that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts and must be dismissed.[Footnote 2]\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given petitioners\u2019 concession, the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2).  Ashcroft and Mueller admit they are liable for their subordinates\u2019 conduct if they \u201chad actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being \u2018of high interest\u2019 and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 50.  Iqbal alleges that after the September 11 attacks the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \u201carrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men,\u201d Complaint \u00b647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, that many of these men were designated by high-ranking FBI officials as being \u201c\u00a0\u2018of high interest,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., \u00b6\u00b648, 50, at 164a, and that in many cases, including Iqbal\u2019s, this designation was made \u201cbecause of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees\u2019 involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\u201d id., \u00b649.  The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft was the \u201cprincipal architect of the policies and practices challenged,\u201d id., \u00b610, at 157a, and that Mueller \u201cwas instrumental in the adoption, promulgation, and implementation of the policies and practices challenged,\u201d id., \u00b611.  According to the complaint, Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [Iqbal] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\u201d  Id., \u00b696, at 172a\u2013173a.  The complaint thus alleges, at a bare minimum, that Ashcroft and Mueller knew of and condoned the discriminatory policy their subordinates carried out.  Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy.  If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the \u201cplausibility standard\u201d of Twombly.  They contend that Iqbal\u2019s claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials \u201ctend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 28.  But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that Twombly demands.  Twombly does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true.  We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be.  See Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555 (a court must proceed \u201con the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\u201d); id., at 556 (\u201c[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable\u201d); see also Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 327 (1989) (\u201cRule 12(b)(6) does not countenance \u2026 dismissals based on a judge\u2019s disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual allegations\u201d).  The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff\u2019s recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel.  That is not what we have here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Twombly, the relevant question is whether, assuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has stated a ground for relief that is plausible.  That is, in Twombly\u2019s words, a plaintiff must \u201callege facts\u201d that, taken as true, are \u201csuggestive of illegal conduct.\u201d  550 U. S., at 564, n.\u00a08.  In Twombly, we were faced with allegations of a conspiracy to violate \u00a71 of the Sherman Act through parallel conduct.  The difficulty was that the conduct alleged was \u201cconsistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\u201d  Id., at 554.  We held that in that sort of circumstance, \u201c[a]n allegation of parallel conduct is \u2026 much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \u00a71 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 557 (brackets omitted).  Here, by contrast, the allegations in the complaint are neither confined to naked legal conclusions nor consistent with legal conduct.  The complaint alleges that FBI officials discriminated against Iqbal solely on account of his race, religion, and national origin, and it alleges the knowledge and deliberate indifference that, by Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s own admission, are sufficient to make them liable for the illegal action.  Iqbal\u2019s complaint therefore contains \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d  Id., at 570.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of \u201cplausibility\u201d under Twombly.  Rather, the majority discards the allegations discussed above with regard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left considering only two statements in the complaint: that \u201cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \u2026 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11,\u201d Complaint \u00b647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001,\u201d id., \u00b669, at 168a.  See ante, at 17.  I think the majority is right in saying that these allegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller \u201csought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity,\u201d ante, at 19, and that this produced \u201ca disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims,\u201d ante, at 18.  And I agree that the two allegations selected by the majority, standing alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to relief for unconstitutional discrimination.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates.  See Complaint \u00b610, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (Ashcroft was the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of the discriminatory policy); id., \u00b611 (Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in adopting and executing the discriminatory policy); id., \u00b696, at 172a\u2013173a (Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\u201d Iqbal to harsh conditions \u201cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority says that these are \u201cbare assertions\u201d that, \u201cmuch like the pleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount to nothing more than a \u2018formulaic recitation of the elements\u2019 of a constitutional discrimination claim\u201d and therefore are \u201cnot entitled to be assumed true.\u201d  Ante, at 17 (quoting Twombly, supra, at 555).  The fallacy of the majority\u2019s position, however, lies in looking at the relevant assertions in isolation.  The complaint contains specific allegations that, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Chief of the FBI\u2019s International Terrorism Operations Section and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office implemented a policy that discriminated against Arab Muslim men, including Iqbal, solely on account of their race, religion, or national origin.  See Complaint \u00b6\u00b647\u201353, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a\u2013165a.  Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as \u201cconclusory\u201d are no such thing.  Iqbal\u2019s claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\u201d him to a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that \u201cthey knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\u201d him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint.  Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described.  Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller \u201c\u00a0\u2018fair notice of what the \u2026 claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555 (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957) (omission in original)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That aside, the majority\u2019s holding that the statements it selects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treatment of certain other allegations in the complaint as nonconclusory.  For example, the majority takes as true the statement that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\u201d  Complaint \u00b669, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a; see ante, at 17.  This statement makes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held certain detainees in highly restrictive conditions, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these conditions.  If, as the majority says, these allegations are not conclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it merely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after September 11, the FBI designated Arab Muslim detainees as being of \u201c\u00a0\u2018high interest\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u201cbecause of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees\u2019 involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\u201d Complaint \u00b6\u00b648\u201350, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\u201d to that discrimination, id., \u00b696, at 172a.  By my lights, there is no principled basis for the majority\u2019s disregard of the allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates\u2019 discrimination.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\u00a0Iqbal makes no claim against Ashcroft and Mueller based simply on his right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free from punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt on the fraud charges.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 535 (1979).\n\u00a0If I am mistaken, and the majority\u2019s rejection of the concession is somehow outcome determinative, then its approach is even more unfair to Iqbal than previously explained, see supra, at 6, for Iqbal had no reason to argue the (apparently dispositive) supervisory liability standard in light of the concession."}, {"id": 1783, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962862, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/662/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1783", "justia_text": "ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, et\u00a0al. v.

Iqbal filed a Bivens action against numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that petitioners designated Iqbal a person \u201cof high interest\u201d on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments; that the FBI, under Mueller\u2019s direction, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th investigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the prohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and that Ashcroft was the policy\u2019s \u201cprincipal architect\u201d and Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in its adoption and execution.  After the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order doctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.  Affirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had jurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  Concluding that Twombly\u2019s \u201cflexible plausibility standard\u201d obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual allegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable in the context of petitioners\u2019 appeal, the court held that Iqbal\u2019s complaint was adequate to allege petitioners\u2019 personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.  \nHeld: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The Second Circuit had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss.

Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530.  The doctrine\u2019s applicability in this context is well established; an order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.

Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 254, n.\u00a02.  Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens and \u00a71983 suits, see, e.g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead that each Government-official defendant, through his own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.  Purposeful discrimination requires more than \u201cintent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences\u201d; it involves a decisionmaker\u2019s undertaking a course of action \u201c\u00a0\u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 [the action\u2019s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279.  Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.  Pp.\u00a011\u201313. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  \u201c[D]etailed factual allegations\u201d are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d id., at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 556.  Two working principles underlie Twombly.  First, the tenet that a court must accept a complaint\u2019s allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action\u2019s elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.  Id., at 555.  Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience and common sense.  Id., at 556.  A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying allegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the complaint\u2019s framework, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.  Pp.\u00a013\u201316. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Iqbal\u2019s pleadings do not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly.  Several of his allegations\u2014that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that Ashcroft was that policy\u2019s \u201cprincipal architect\u201d; and that Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in its adoption and execution\u2014are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  Moreover, the factual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft approved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that petitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds.  Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy\u2019s purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  Even if the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbal\u2019s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees categorized as \u201cof high interest,\u201d but the complaint does not contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory factors.  Pp.\u00a016\u201320. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Three of Iqbal\u2019s arguments are rejected.

Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn governs the pleading standard \u201cin all civil actions,\u201d Rule 1, the case applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550 U. S., at 555\u2013556, and n.\u00a014.

The question presented by a motion to dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed on the discovery process.  Twombly, supra, at 559.  And because Iqbal\u2019s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.  Pp.\u00a020\u201322. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii)\u00a0Rule 9(b)\u2014which requires particularity when pleading \u201cfraud or mistake\u201d but allows \u201cother conditions of a person\u2019s mind [to] be alleged generally\u201d\u2014does not require courts to credit a complaint\u2019s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.  Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.

ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[May 18, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a citizen of Pakistan and a Muslim.  In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials.  Respondent claims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while in federal custody.  To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numerous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case now before us.  As to these two petitioners, the complaint alleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race, religion, or national origin.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the District Court petitioners raised the defense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit, contending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim against them.  The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite petitioners\u2019 official status at the times in question.  Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The court, without discussion, assumed it had jurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent\u2019s account of his prison ordeal could, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors.  But the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors are not before us here.  This case instead turns on a narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the District Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states a claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights.  We hold respondent\u2019s pleadings are insufficient.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the 2001 attacks, the FBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an investigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent them from attacking anew.  The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor.  By September 18 \u201cthe FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.\u201d  Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks 1, 11\u201312 (Apr. 2003) (hereinafter OIG Report), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf (as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to terrorism in general.  Id., at 1.  Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be \u201cof \u2018high interest\u2019\u00a0\u201d to the investigation.  Id., at 111.  The high-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions designed to prevent them from communicating with the general prison population or the outside world.  Id., at 112\u2013113.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent was one of the detainees.  According to his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of fraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States.  Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.\u00a03d 143, 147\u2013148 (CA2 2007).  Pending trial for those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York.  Respondent was designated a person \u201cof high interest\u201d to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was placed in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU).  Id., at 148.  As the facility\u2019s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison regulations.  Ibid.  ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer escort.  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his native Pakistan.  Id., at 149.  He then filed a Bivens action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal officials and 19 \u201cJohn Doe\u201d federal corrections officers.  See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971).  The defendants range from the correctional officers who had day-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his confinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to petitioners\u2014officials who were at the highest level of the federal law enforcement hierarchy.  First Amended Complaint in No. 04\u2013CV\u20131809 (JG)(JA), \u00b6\u00b61011, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (hereinafter Complaint).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not challenge respondent\u2019s arrest or his confinement in the MDC\u2019s general prison population.  Rather, it concentrates on his treatment while confined to the ADMAX SHU.  The complaint sets forth various claims against defendants who are not before us.  For instance, the complaint alleges that respondent\u2019s jailors \u201ckicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across\u201d his cell without justification, id., \u00b6113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when he posed no safety risk to himself or others, id., \u00b6\u00b6143\u2013145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and other Muslims pray because there would be \u201c[n]o prayers for terrorists,\u201d id., \u00b6154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The allegations against petitioners are the only ones relevant here.  The complaint contends that petitioners designated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.  The complaint alleges that \u201cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \u2026 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\u201d  Id., \u00b647, at 164a.  It further alleges that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\u201d  Id., \u00b669, at 168a.  Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners \u201ceach knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\u201d respondent to harsh conditions of confinement \u201cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\u201d  Id., \u00b696, at 172a\u2013173a.  The pleading names Ashcroft as the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of the policy, id., \u00b610, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as \u201cinstrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.\u201d  Id., \u00b611, at 157a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct.  The District Court denied their motion.  Accepting all of the allegations in respondent\u2019s complaint as true, the court held that \u201cit cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against\u201d petitioners.  Id., at 136a\u2013137a (relying on Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41 (1957)).  Invoking the collateral-order doctrine petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, this Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007), which discussed the standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals considered Twombly\u2019s applicability to this case.  Acknowledging that Twombly retired the Conley no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion discussed at length how to apply this Court\u2019s \u201cstandard for assessing the adequacy of pleadings.\u201d  490 F.\u00a03d, at 155.  It concluded that Twombly called for a \u201cflexible \u2018plausibility standard,\u2019 which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim plausible.\u201d  Id., at 157\u2013158.  The court found that petitioners\u2019 appeal did not present one of \u201cthose contexts\u201d requiring amplification.  As a consequence, it held respondent\u2019s pleading adequate to allege petitioners\u2019 personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law.  Id., at 174.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Cabranes concurred.  He agreed that the majority\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of the relevant pleading standards reflect[ed] the uneasy compromise \u2026 between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of government as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d  Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at the prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government officials\u2014entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and charged with responding to \u201ca national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic\u201d\u2014to the burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific as respondent\u2019s.  Id., at 179.  Reluctant to vindicate that concern as a member of the Court of Appeals, ibid., Judge Cabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading standard \u201cat the earliest opportunity.\u201d  Id., at 178.  We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first address whether the Court of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss.  Respondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue.  We are not free to pretermit the question.  Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630 (2002)).  According to respondent, the District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss is not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.  We disagree.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With exceptions inapplicable here, Congress has vested the courts of appeals with \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d  28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.  Though the statute\u2019s finality requirement ensures that \u201cinterlocutory appeals\u2014appeals before the end of district court proceedings\u2014are the exception, not the rule,\u201d Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309 (1995), it does not prevent \u201creview of all prejudgment orders.\u201d  Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 305 (1996).  Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of district-court orders are reviewable \u201cthough short of final judgment.\u201d  Ibid.  The orders within this narrow category \u201care immediately appealable because they \u2018finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A district-court decision denying a Government officer\u2019s claim of qualified immunity can fall within the narrow class of appealable orders despite \u201cthe absence of a final judgment.\u201d  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985).  This is so because qualified immunity\u2014which shields Government officials \u201cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights,\u201d Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982)\u2014is both a defense to liability and a limited \u201centitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\u201d  Mitchell, supra, 472 U. S., at 526.  Provided it \u201cturns on an issue of law,\u201d id., at 530, a district-court order denying qualified immunity \u201c\u00a0\u2018conclusively determine[s]\u2019\u00a0\u201d that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery; is \u201cconceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d; and would prove \u201ceffectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d  Id., at 527528 (citing Cohen, supra, at 546).  As a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in Cohen.  But the applicability of the doctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this Court has been careful to say that a district court\u2019s order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of \u00a71291.  Behrens, 516 U. S., at 307.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying these principles, we conclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear petitioners\u2019 appeal.  The District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and rejected the defense of qualified immunity.  It was therefore a final decision \u201csubject to immediate appeal.\u201d  Ibid.  Respondent says that \u201ca qualified immunity appeal based solely on the complaint\u2019s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\u201d  Brief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief).  In other words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation but that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings.  Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), the Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified immunity.  The legal issue decided in Hartman concerned the elements a plaintiff \u201cmust plead and prove in order to win\u201d a First Amendment retaliation claim.  Id., at 257, n.\u00a05.  Similarly, two Terms ago in Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying qualified immunity.  The legal issue there was whether a Bivens action can be employed to challenge interference with property rights.  551 U. S., at 549, n.\u00a04.  These cases cannot be squared with respondent\u2019s argument that the collateral-order doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the \u201cultimate issu[e]\u201d whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation of clearly established law while excluding the question whether the facts pleaded establish such a violation.  Iqbal Brief 15.  Indeed, the latter question is even more clearly within the category of appealable decisions than the questions presented in Hartman and Wilkie, since whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded.  In that sense the sufficiency of respondent\u2019s pleadings is both \u201cinextricably intertwined with,\u201d Swint v. Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 35, 51 (1995), and \u201cdirectly implicated by,\u201d Hartman, supra, at 257, n.\u00a05, the qualified immunity defense.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent counters that our holding in Johnson, 515 U. S. 304, confirms the want of subject-matter jurisdiction here.  That is incorrect.  The allegation in Johnson was that five defendants, all of them police officers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff.  Johnson considered \u201cthe appealability of a portion of\u201d the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order that, \u201cthough entered in a \u2018qualified immunity\u2019 case, determine[d] only\u201d that there was a genuine issue of material fact that three of the defendants participated in the beating.  Id., at 313.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In finding that order not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of \u00a71291, the Johnson Court cited Mitchell for the proposition that only decisions turning \u201c\u00a0\u2018on an issue of law\u2019\u00a0\u201d are subject to immediate appeal.  515 U. S., at 313.  Though determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits near the law-fact divide.  Or as we said in Johnson, it is a \u201cfact-related\u201d legal inquiry.  Id., at 314.  To conduct it, a court of appeals may be required to consult a \u201cvast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\u201d  Id., at 316.  That process generally involves matters more within a district court\u2019s ken and may replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal following final judgment.  Ibid.  Finding those concerns predominant, Johnson held that the collateral orders that are \u201cfinal\u201d under Mitchell turn on \u201cabstract,\u201d rather than \u201cfact-based,\u201d issues of law.  515 U. S., at 317.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concerns that animated the decision in Johnson are absent when an appellate court considers the disposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings.  True, the categories of \u201cfact-based\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d legal questions used to guide the Court\u2019s decision in Johnson are not well defined.  Here, however, the order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss falls well within the latter class.  Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only the allegations contained within the four corners of respondent\u2019s complaint; resort to a \u201cvast pretrial record\u201d on petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss was unnecessary.  Id., at 316.  And determining whether respondent\u2019s complaint has the \u201cheft\u201d to state a claim is a task well within an appellate court\u2019s core competency.  Twombly, 550 U. S., at 557.  Evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a \u201cfact-based\u201d question of law, so the problem the Court sought to avoid in Johnson is not implicated here.  The District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine over which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction.  We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners\u2019 appeal.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Twombly, supra, at 553\u2013554, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the complaint.  Here too we begin by taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Bivens\u2014proceeding on the theory that a right suggests a remedy\u2014this Court \u201crecognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d  Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001).  Because implied causes of action are disfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability \u201cto any new context or new category of defendants.\u201d  534 U. S., at 68.  See also Wilkie, 551 U. S., at 549\u00a0\u2013550.  That reluctance might well have disposed of respondent\u2019s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination.  For while we have allowed a Bivens action to redress a violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, see Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we have not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise Clause.  Indeed, we have declined to extend Bivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.  Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367 (1983).  Petitioners do not press this argument, however, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent\u2019s First Amendment claim is actionable under Bivens.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the limited settings where Bivens does apply, the implied cause of action is the \u201cfederal analog to suits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.\u201d  Hartman, 547 U. S., at 254, n.\u00a02.  Cf. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 609 (1999).  Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent correctly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior.  Iqbal Brief 46 (\u201c[I]t is undisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be established solely on a theory of respondeat superior\u201d).  See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a municipal \u201cperson\u201d under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983); see also Dunlop v. Munroe, 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a federal official\u2019s liability \u201cwill only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge\u201d of his subordinates\u2019 duties); Robertson v. Sichel, 127 U. S. 507, 515\u2013516 (1888) (\u201cA public officer or agent is not responsible for the misfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or negligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or other persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge of his official duties\u201d).  Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens and \u00a71983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official\u2019s own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation will vary with the constitutional provision at issue.  Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose.  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 540\u2013541 (1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment).  Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than \u201cintent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.\u201d  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279 (1979).  It instead involves a decisionmaker\u2019s undertaking a course of action \u201c\u00a0\u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 [the action\u2019s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d  Ibid.  It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent disagrees.  He argues that, under a theory of \u201csupervisory liability,\u201d petitioners can be liable for \u201cknowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates\u2019 use of discriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees.\u201d  Iqbal Brief 45\u201346.  That is to say, respondent believes a supervisor\u2019s mere knowledge of his subordinate\u2019s discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor\u2019s violating the Constitution.  We reject this argument.  Respondent\u2019s conception of \u201csupervisory liability\u201d is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that petitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds of their agents.  In a \u00a71983 suit or a Bivens action\u2014where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants\u2014the term \u201csupervisory liability\u201d is a misnomer.  Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.  In the context of determining whether there is a violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose Bivens liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.\nIV\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn to respondent\u2019s complaint.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  As the Court held in Twombly, 550 U. S. 544, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.  Id., at 555 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265, 286 (1986)).  A pleading that offers \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d  550 U. S., at 555.  Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \u201cnaked assertion[s]\u201d devoid of \u201cfurther factual enhancement.\u201d  Id., at 557.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d  Id., at 570.  A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 556.  The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.  Ibid.  Where a complaint pleads facts that are \u201cmerely consistent with\u201d a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u201cstops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 557 (brackets omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two working principles underlie our decision in Twombly.  First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.  Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.  Id., at 555 (Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we \u201care not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions.  Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.  Id., at 556.  Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.  490 F.\u00a03d, at 157\u2013158.  But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged\u2014but it has not \u201cshow[n]\u201d\u2014\u201cthat the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Twombly illustrates the two-pronged approach.  There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71.  Recognizing that \u00a71 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct \u201ceffected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,\u201d Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 775 (1984), the plaintiffs in Twombly flatly pleaded that the defendants \u201cha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry \u2026 and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.\u201d  550 U. S., at 551 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The complaint also alleged that the defendants\u2019 \u201cparallel course of conduct \u2026 to prevent competition\u201d and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court held the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint deficient under Rule 8.  In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of an unlawful agreement was a \u201c\u00a0\u2018legal conclusion\u2019\u00a0\u201d and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth.  Id., at 555. Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce.  The Court next addressed the \u201cnub\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\u2014the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior\u2014to determine whether it gave rise to a \u201cplausible suggestion of conspiracy.\u201d  Id., at 565\u2013566.  Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior.  Id., at 567.  Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint must be dismissed.  Id., at 570.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Twombly\u2019s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent\u2019s complaint has not \u201cnudged [his] claims\u201d of invidious discrimination \u201cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth.  Respondent pleads that petitioners \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]\u201d to harsh conditions of confinement \u201cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\u201d  Complaint \u00b696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a\u2013174a.  The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of this invidious policy, id., \u00b610, at 157a, and that Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in adopting and executing it, id., \u00b611, at 157a.  These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount to nothing more than a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements\u201d of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U. S., at 555, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy \u201c\u00a0\u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d  Feeney, 442 U. S., at 279. As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.  Twombly, supra, 550 U. S., at 554\u2013555.  To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical.  We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in Twombly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 express allegation of a \u201c\u00a0\u2018contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 551, because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained.  It is the conclusory nature of respondent\u2019s allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We next consider the factual allegations in respondent\u2019s complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.  The complaint alleges that \u201cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men \u2026 as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\u201d  Complaint \u00b647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a.  It further claims that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\u201d  Id., \u00b669, at 168a.  Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners\u2019 purposefully designating detainees \u201cof high interest\u201d because of their race, religion, or national origin.  But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group.  Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim\u2014Osama bin Laden\u2014and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples.  It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.  On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts.  As between that \u201cobvious alternative explanation\u201d for the arrests, Twombly, supra, at 567, and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent\u2019s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief.  It is important to recall that respondent\u2019s complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC.  Respondent\u2019s constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible \u201cpolicy of holding post-September-11th detainees\u201d in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as \u201cof high interest.\u201d  Complaint \u00b669, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a.  To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as \u201cof high interest\u201d because of their race, religion, or national origin.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This the complaint fails to do.  Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of \u201cof high interest\u201d for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving \u201crestrictive conditions of confinement\u201d for post-September-11 detainees until they were \u201c\u00a0\u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI.\u201d  Ibid.  Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin.  All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation\u2019s top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity.  Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners\u2019 constitutional obligations.  He would need to allege more by way of factual content to \u201cnudg[e]\u201d his claim of purposeful discrimination \u201cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d  Twombly, 550 U. S., at 570.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, respondent can attempt to draw certain contrasts between the pleadings the Court considered in Twombly and the pleadings at issue here.  In Twombly, the complaint alleged general wrongdoing that extended over a period of years, id., at 551, whereas here the complaint alleges discrete wrongs\u2014for instance, beatings\u2014by lower level Government actors.  The allegations here, if true, and if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for some inference of wrongful intent on petitioners\u2019 part.  Despite these distinctions, respondent\u2019s pleadings do not suffice to state a claim.  Unlike in Twombly, where the doctrine of respondeat superior could bind the corporate defendant, here, as we have noted, petitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic.  Yet respondent\u2019s complaint does not contain any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest petitioners\u2019 discriminatory state of mind.  His pleadings thus do not meet the standard necessary to comply with Rule 8.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent\u2019s complaint against the defendants who are not before us.  Respondent\u2019s account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here.  Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent\u2019s complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.  \nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent offers three arguments that bear on our disposition of his case, but none is persuasive.\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent first says that our decision in Twombly should be limited to pleadings made in the context of an antitrust dispute.  Iqbal Brief 37\u201338.  This argument is not supported by Twombly and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Though Twombly determined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in antitrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and application of Rule 8.  550 U. S., at 554.  That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard \u201cin all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\u201d  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1.  Our decision in Twombly expounded the pleading standard for \u201call civil actions,\u201d ibid., and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike.  See 550 U. S., at 555\u2013556, and n.\u00a03.\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has \u201cinstructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve\u201d petitioners\u2019 defense of qualified immunity \u201cas much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.\u201d  Iqbal Brief 27.  We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process.  Twombly, supra, at 559 (\u201cIt is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process through careful case management given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been on the modest side\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.  The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including \u201cavoidance of disruptive discovery.\u201d  Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  There are serious and legitimate reasons for this.  If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed.  Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government.  The costs of diversion are only magnified when Government officials are charged with responding to, as Judge Cabranes aptly put it, \u201ca national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic.\u201d  490 F.\u00a03d, at 179.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants.  It is quite likely that, when discovery as to the other parties proceeds, it would prove necessary for petitioners and their counsel to participate in the process to ensure the case does not develop in a misleading or slanted way that causes prejudice to their position.  Even if petitioners are not yet themselves subject to discovery orders, then, they would not be free from the burdens of discovery.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We decline respondent\u2019s invitation to relax the pleading requirements on the ground that the Court of Appeals promises petitioners minimally intrusive discovery.  That promise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading context, where we are impelled to give real content to the concept of qualified immunity for high-level officials who must be neither deterred nor detracted from the vigorous performance of their duties.  Because respondent\u2019s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners\u2019 discriminatory intent \u201cgenerally,\u201d which he equates with a conclusory allegation.  Iqbal Brief 32 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9).  It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him \u201con account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\u201d  Complaint \u00b696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a\u2013173a.  Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent\u2019s complaint would survive petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss.  But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint\u2019s conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading \u201cfraud or mistake,\u201d while allowing \u201c[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind [to] be alleged generally.\u201d  But \u201cgenerally\u201d is a relative term.  In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake.  Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard.  It does not give him license to evade the less rigid\u2014though still operative\u2014strictures of Rule 8.  See 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71301, p.\u00a0291 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201c[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of a condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent overriding considerations pressing for a specificity requirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mistake, the general \u2018short and plain statement of the claim\u2019 mandate in Rule 8(a) \u2026 should control the second sentence of Rule 9(b)\u201d).

He was found responsible for having caused over $600 million in damages and sentenced to 41 months imprisonment. Subsequently, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined that Mr. Nijhawan had committed an \"aggravated felony\" and was subject to deportation because his offense involved fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeded $10,000. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Mr. Nijhawan argued that 1) his offense did not involve fraud or deceit as those terms are used in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and 2) that his conviction did not establish that loss to his victims exceeded $10,000. The court of appeals affirmed the BIA's findings and refuted Mr. Nijhawan's arguments. It held that Mr. Nijhawan's offenses constituted fraud or deceit as understood by the INA and that his conviction did establish that the loss to his victims exceeded $10,000, even though the jury did not determine that amount.</p>\n", "question": "<p>When a person is convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud and held responsible for having caused more than $10,000 in damages, but the sum is not established by a jury, does this satisfy the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act in order to deport an alien for having committed an \"offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss of victims exceeds $10,000?\"</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court held that the $10,000 threshold stated by the Immigration and Nationality Act refers merely to the particular circumstances in which an offense is committed, and does not require that the statute used to convict the potential deportee contain $10,000 in damages as an element of the crime. Here, the Court reasoned that the statute used to convict Mr. Nijhawan for conspiracy did not require that he cause a minimum of $10,000 in damages; but regardless, the jury's computation of damages at his sentencing was sufficient to meet the requirements of the INA to trigger his deportation.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 43101, "name": "Thomas E.

Before trial, he filed a motion to suppress his oral and written confessions. The federal district court dismissed the motion. After his conviction, Mr. Corley appealed arguing his motion was improperly dismissed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.</p>\n<p>The court recognized that federal statutes require federal officials to bring persons they arrest before judicial officers without unnecessary delay. Confessions received after such delays and before the arrested person is presented before a federal magistrate should be suppressed. Mr. Corley's confessions fell under these guidelines. However, the court reasoned that the voluntariness of a confession was an overriding factor in determining admissibility. Mr. Corley voluntarily confessed. Therefore, his confessions were admissible.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does 18 U.S.C. Section 3501 supplant Supreme Court precedent and make admissible voluntary confessions that are taken more than six hours after arrest and before that person has been presented before judicial officers?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. With Justice David H. Souter writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Supreme Court held that its decisions in <em>McNabb</em> and <em>Mallory</em> were not supplanted by 18 U.S.C. Section 3501. Therefore, confessions made during periods of detention that violate the prompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure remain generally inadmissible -- even voluntary ones.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin G. Scalia and Clarence Thomas. He argued that 18 U.S.C. Section 3501 is unambiguous in stating, \"[i]n any criminal prosecution brought by the United States\u2026a confession\u2026shall be admissible in evidence if it is given voluntarily.\" Therefore, Mr. Corley's voluntary confession should not be suppressed.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 21246, "name": "David L.

On appeal, he argued that his conviction was in error because the government did not prove he knew the identification he possessed belonged to another person. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court's decision.

The Supreme Court held that the government needs to prove that the defendant \"knew\" that the identification he possessed belonged to another person. With Justice Stephen G. Breyer writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court reasoned that ordinary grammar indicates that \"knowingly\" should be read to apply to all subsequently listed elements of the crime in the relevant statute.</p>\n<p>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a separate concurring opinion and concurred in the judgment. He was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Scalia argued that the Court should distinguish between those cases where it should infer a <em>mens rea</em> requirement when Congress has not addressed it within the statute, and those cases when Congress has intentionally limited the <em>mens rea</em> requirement to particular elements of the relevant crime. Justice Samuel A. Alito also wrote separately, concurring and concurring in the judgment. He noted his concern that the majority opinion may be read as a rigid rule of statutory construction where the <em>mens rea</em> requirement of a federal criminal statute will always apply to every element of the relevant crime.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 33970, "name": "Kevin K.

Jacqueline's mother reported these allegations to the school but its immediate investigation into the matter, including interviewing the supposed perpetrator, the school bus driver, and many students on the bus, did not provide any further proof of the sexual harassment. After Jacqueline told her parents about further instances of mistreatment, the local police department began its own investigation but was unable to find sufficient evidence to bring criminal proceedings against the alleged harasser. Jacqueline reported other incidents throughout the year, and each was addressed by the school's principal as it occurred. In April of 2002 the Fitzgeralds brought suit against the school district in federal court alleging violations of both Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 and 42 U.S.C. 1983 (Section 1983). Title IX prohibits discrimination by any educational entity receiving federal funding, while Section 1983 protects against the deprivation of any rights guaranteed by the Constitution and federal laws. The district court granted the school district's motion to dismiss both counts and the Fitzgeralds appealed.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of both claims. First, discussing the Title IX claim, the court stated that five conditions must be met for a plaintiff to succeed: the student must prove that (1) the institution is a recipient of federal funding, (2) severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment occurred, (3) the harassment denied the student of educational opportunities or benefits, (4) the institution had actual knowledge of the harassment, and (5) the institution's deliberate indifference caused the student to be subjected to the harassment. The First Circuit held that even if the first four factors were met in this case, the school's \"prompt\" and \"diligent\" investigation was not clearly unreasonable and therefore did not amount to deliberate indifference. Rather, the school looked into each allegation quickly and thoroughly. The court also affirmed the dismissal of the Fitzgeralds' Section 1983 claim, applying the so-called \"remedial\" exception prohibiting such claims when the allegedly violated federal law is itself specific enough to demonstrate Congress' intention to allow only those remedies referred to in the statute itself. According to the First Circuit, Title IX is one of these remedial statutes and therefore any alleged violations of the statute cannot be litigated under Section 1983.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is Title IX's implied private remedy sufficiently comprehensive to preclude the use of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 to advance sex discrimination claims against federally funded educational institutions?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. It held that a claim filed under Title IX for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude the use of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 to further constitutional claims. The Court reasoned that Title IX was not meant to be the exclusive tool for addressing gender discrimination in schools, or a substitute for actions filed under Section 1983 to enforce constitutional rights.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 19917, "name": "Charles A.

The Supreme Court held that the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) and not the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had authority to grant permits allowing Coeur Alaska Inc. to discharge processed wastewater into a lake in Alaska. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, and joined in part by Justice Antonin G. Scalia, the Court stated that both the USACE and EPA agreed on a common definition of \"fill material,\" which described the discharge planned by Coeur at its mining site in Alaska. Further, since the USACE had exclusive rights to grant permits relating to the discharge of fill material, the Court reasoned that it was clear that USACE had authority to grant Coeur a permit to discharge its waste at its mining site.</p>\n<p>Justice Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion, attempting to assuage concerns that the Court's decision will be seen as a loophole for polluters, so long as they dump enough pollutant into a lake for it to be considered \"fill material.\" Justice Scalia also wrote separately concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter. She argued that the relevant inquiry should have stopped at the determination that Coeur failed to meet EPA performance standards by discharging its wastewater in an Alaska lake.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25346, "name": "Gregory G.

The AT&amp;T policy considered temporary disability leave as service time for the purposes of calculating retirement benefits except when the leave was taken by pregnant women. The employees argued that the policy violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA), which clarified that Title VII prohibits discrimination \"because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\" The main issue in the case was one of timing: although the employees' pregnancy leave was taken before the PDA came into effect, AT&amp;T's calculation of benefits took place after. The employees argued that under the Court's decision in <em>Pallas</em> the time of calculation should govern the applicability of the PDA. AT&amp;T countered that another decision, <em>Landgraf</em> directly opposed <em>Pallas</em> and had created a \"sea change\" in retroactivity principles such that the PDA should not apply to pregnancy leave taken before it was enacted. The district court sided with the employees and granted summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit initially reversed the lower court, agreeing with AT&amp;T that <em>Pallas</em> gave impermissible retroactive effect to the PDA. On rehearing, the full court reversed and ruled in favor of the employees, avoiding the retroactivity problem by holding that the PDA applies to the actual calculation of pension and retirement benefits regardless of when the leave itself was taken. Because AT&amp;T performed this calculation after the PDA had gone into effect, the denial of benefits violated Title VII.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Under the Court's decisions in <em>Pallas</em> and <em>Landgraf</em>, does a company violate the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by denying retirement benefits to women who took temporary disability leave while pregnant when the leave was taken before the PDA came into effect but the calculation of benefits took place after?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court held that a company does not necessarily violate the PDA or Title VII when it denies retirement benefits to women who take a temporary disability leave while pregnant when the leave was taken before the PDA came into effect. With Justice David H. Souter writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that since AT&amp;T's seniority system was not discriminatory at its adoption, its limiting seniority credit for time taken during pregnancy did not constitute unlawful discrimination. Rather, the limitation of seniority credit for pregnant women could only violate the PDA or Title VII if AT&amp;T's system had been unlawful at its adoption.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens also wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented and was joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer. She argued that AT&amp;T violated the PDA and Title VII when it did not discontinue reliance upon a benefit calculation system which contained pregnancy-based seniority classifications.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 19760, "name": "Carter G.

Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court held that a classification harmful to women based on pregnancy did not qualify as discrimination \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).  Exclusion of pregnancy from an employer\u2019s disability benefits plan, the Court ruled, \u201cis not a gender-based discrimination at all.\u201d  429 U. S., at 136.  See also id., at 138 (describing G. E.\u2019s plan as \u201cfacially nondiscriminatory\u201d and without \u201cany gender-based discriminatory effect\u201d).[Footnote 1]  In dissent, Justice Stevens wondered how the Court could come to that conclusion, for \u201cit is the capacity to become pregnant which primarily differentiates the female from the male.\u201d  Id., at 162.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to Gilbert, all Federal Courts of Appeals presented with the question had determined that pregnancy discrimination violated Title VII.[Footnote 2]  Guidelines issued in 1972 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) declared that disadvantageous classifications of employees based on pregnancy-related conditions are \u201cin prima facie violation of Title VII.\u201d  37 Fed. Reg. 6837 (1972).  In terms closely resembling the EEOC\u2019s current Guideline, see 29 CFR \u00a71604.10 (2008), the Commission counseled:\n\u201cWritten and unwritten employment policies and practices involving \u2026 the accrual of seniority and other benefits and privileges \u2026 shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary disabilities.\u201d  37 Fed. Reg. 6837.\n\nThe history of women in the paid labor force underpinned and corroborated the views of the lower courts and the EEOC.  In generations preceding\u2014and lingering long after\u2014the passage of Title VII, that history demonstrates, societal attitudes about pregnancy and motherhood severely impeded women\u2019s employment opportunities.  See Molnar, \u201cHas the Millennium Yet Dawned?\u201d: A History of Attitudes Toward Pregnant Workers in America, 12 Mich. J. Gender & L. 163, 170\u2013176 (2005); S. Kamerman, A. Kahn, & P. Kingston, Maternity Policies and Working Women 32\u201338 (1983).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress swiftly reacted to the Gilbert decision.  Less than two years after the Court\u2019s ruling, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) to overturn Gilbert and make plain the legislators\u2019 clear understanding that discrimination based on pregnancy is discrimination against women.[Footnote 3]  The Act amended Title VII to require that women affected by pregnancy \u201cbe treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d  42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e(k).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The PDA does not require redress for past discrimination.  It does not oblige employers to make women whole for the compensation denied them when, prior to the Act, they were placed on pregnancy leave, often while still ready, willing, and able to work, and with no secure right to return to their jobs after childbirth.[Footnote 4]  But the PDA does protect women, from and after April 1979, when the Act became fully effective, against repetition or continuation of pregnancy-based disadvantageous treatment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress interred Gilbert more than 30 years ago, but the Court today allows that wrong decision still to hold sway.  The plaintiffs (now respondents) in this action will receive, for the rest of their lives, lower pension benefits than colleagues who worked for AT&T no longer than they did.  They will experience this discrimination not simply because of the adverse action to which they were subjected pre-PDA.  Rather, they are harmed today because AT&T has refused fully to heed the PDA\u2019s core command: Hereafter, for \u201call employment-related purposes,\u201d disadvantageous treatment \u201con the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions\u201d must cease.  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k) (emphasis added).  I would hold that AT&T committed a current violation of Title VII when, post-PDA, it did not totally discontinue reliance upon a pension calculation premised on the notion that pregnancy-based classifications display no gender bias.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enacted as an addition to the section defining terms used in Title VII, the PDA provides:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe terms \u2018because of sex\u2019 or \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work \u2026\u00a0.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k).\n\nThe text of the Act, this Court has acknowledged, \u201cunambiguously expressed [Congress\u2019] disapproval of both the holding and the reasoning of the Court in the Gilbert decision.\u201d  Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 678 (1983).  \u201cProponents of the [PDA],\u201d the Court observed, \u201crepeatedly emphasized that the Supreme Court had erroneously interpreted congressional intent and that amending legislation was necessary to reestablish the principles of Title VII law as they had been understood prior to the Gilbert decision.\u201d  Id., at 679.  See also California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 284\u2013285 (1987) (explaining that \u201cthe first clause of the PDA reflects Congress\u2019 disapproval of the reasoning in Gilbert,\u201d while \u201cthe second clause \u2026 illustrate[s] how discrimination against pregnancy is to be remedied\u201d).  Cf. Newport News, 462 U. S., at 694 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (criticizing the Court for concluding that the PDA \u201crenders all of Gilbert obsolete\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today\u2019s case presents a question of time.  As the Court comprehends the PDA, even after the effective date of the Act, lower pension benefits perpetually can be paid to women whose pregnancy leaves predated the PDA.  As to those women, the Court reasons, the disadvantageous treatment remains as Gilbert declared it to be: \u201cfacially nondiscriminatory,\u201d and without \u201cany gender-based discriminatory effect,\u201d 429 U. S., at 138.  See ante, at 8.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is another way to read the PDA, one better attuned to Congress\u2019 \u201cunambiguou[s] \u2026 disapproval of both the holding and the reasoning\u201d in Gilbert.  Newport News, 462 U. S., at 678.  On this reading, the Act calls for an immediate end to any pretense that classification on the basis of pregnancy can be \u201cfacially nondiscriminatory.\u201d  While the PDA does not reach back to redress discrimination women encountered before Congress overruled Gilbert, the Act instructs employers forthwith to cease and desist: From and after the PDA\u2019s effective date, classifications treating pregnancy disadvantageously must be recognized, \u201cfor all employment-related purposes,\u201d including pension payments, as discriminatory both on their face and in their impact.  So comprehended, the PDA requires AT&T to pay Noreen Hulteen and others similarly\nsituated pension benefits untainted by pregnancy-based discrimination.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 claims to pension benefits undiminished by discrimination \u201cbecause of [their] sex,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h), centers on \u00a7703(h) of Title VII, as construed by this Court in Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977).  See ante, at 4\u20138.  Section 703(h) permits employers \u201cto apply different standards of compensation \u2026 pursuant to a bona fide seniority \u2026 system.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h).  Congress enacted \u00a7703(h), Teamsters explained, to \u201cexten[d] a measure of immunity\u201d to seniority systems even when they \u201coperate to \u2018freeze\u2019 the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.\u201d  431 U. S., at 350 (quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 430 (1971)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Teamsters involved a seniority system attacked under Title VII as perpetuating race-based discrimination.  Minority group members ranked low on the seniority list because, pre-Title VII, they were locked out of the job category in question.  But the seniority system itself, the Court reasoned, \u201cdid not have its genesis in \u2026 discrimination,\u201d contained no discriminatory terms, and applied \u201cequally to all races and ethnic groups,\u201d 431 U. S., at 355\u2013356.  Therefore, the Court concluded, \u00a7703(h) sheltered the system despite its adverse impact on minority group members only recently hired for, or allowed to transfer into, more desirable jobs.  See id., at 356.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case differs from Teamsters because AT&T\u2019s seniority system itself was infected by an overt differential.  Cf. ante, at 8 (\u201c[R]ule of differential treatment was an element of the seniority system itself \u2026\u00a0.\u201d).  One could scarcely maintain that AT&T\u2019s scheme was \u201cneutral on [its] face and in intent,\u201d discriminating against women only \u201cin effect.\u201d  Cf. Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 349.  Surely not a term fairly described as \u201cequally [applicable] to all,\u201d id., at 355, AT&T\u2019s prescription regarding pregnancy leave would gain no immunity under \u00a7703(h) but for this Court\u2019s astonishing declaration in Gilbert: \u201c[E]xclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage,\u201d the Court decreed, \u201c[was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.\u201d  429 U. S., at 136.  See ante, at 8 (because of Gilbert, AT&T\u2019s disadvantageous treatment of pregnancy leave \u201cdid not taint the system under the terms of [\u00a7703(h)]\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were the PDA an ordinary instance of legislative revision by Congress in response to this Court\u2019s construction of a statutory text, I would not dissent from today\u2019s decision.  But Congress made plain its view that Gilbert was not simply wrong about the character of a classification that treats leave necessitated by pregnancy and childbirth disadvantageously.  In disregarding the opinions of other courts, see supra, at 2, n.\u00a02, of the agency that superintends enforcement of Title VII, see supra, at 2,[Footnote 5] and, most fundamentally, the root cause of discrimination against women in the paid labor force, this Court erred egregiously.  Congress did not provide a remedy for pregnancy-based discrimination already experienced before the PDA became effective.  I am persuaded by the Act\u2019s text and legislative history, however, that Congress intended no continuing reduction of women\u2019s compensation, pension benefits included, attributable to their placement on pregnancy leave.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few further considerations influence my dissenting view.  Seeking equal treatment only from and after the PDA\u2019s effective date, plaintiffs present modest claims.  As the Court observes, they seek service credit, for pension benefit purposes, for the periods of their pregnancy leaves.  For the named plaintiffs, whose claims are typical, the uncounted leave days are these: \u201cseven months \u2026 for Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.\u201d  Ante, at 3.  See also 498 F.\u00a03d 1001, 1004 (CA9 2007) (en banc) (case below).  Their demands can be met without disturbing settled expectations of other workers, the core concern underlying the shelter \u00a7703(h) provides for seniority systems.  See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S. 747, 766, 773, and n. 33 (1976) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018benefit\u2019 seniority,\u201d unlike \u201c\u00a0\u2018competitive status\u2019 seniority,\u201d does not conflict with economic interests of other employees).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as Judge Rymer explained in her opinion dissenting from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s initial panel opinion, 441 F.\u00a03d 653, 665\u2013666 (2006), the relief plaintiffs request is not retroactive in character.  Plaintiffs request no backpay or other compensation for past injury.  They seek pension benefits, now and in the future, equal to the benefits received by others employed for the same length of time.  The actionable conduct of which they complain is AT&T\u2019s denial of equal benefits to plaintiffs \u201cin the post-PDA world.\u201d  Id., at 667.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does it appear that equal benefits for plaintiffs during their retirement years would expose AT&T to an excessive or unmanageable cost.  The plaintiffs\u2019 class is not large; it comprises only women whose pregnancy leaves predated April 29, 1979 and whose employment continued long enough for their pensions to vest.  The periods of service involved are short\u2014several weeks or some months, not years.  And the cost of equal treatment would be spread out over many years, as eligible women retire.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth, throughout human history, have sustained pervasive, often law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman\u2019s place among paid workers and active citizens.  This Court so recognized in Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721 (2003).  Hibbs rejected challenges, under the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments, to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 6, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72601 et seq., as applied to state employees.  The Court\u2019s opinion featured Congress\u2019 recognition that,\n\u201c[h]istorically, denial or curtailment of women\u2019s employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second.  This prevailing ideology about women\u2019s roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be.\u201d Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 100 (1986) (quoted in Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 736).[Footnote 6]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several of our own decisions, the opinion in Hibbs acknowledged, 538 U. S., at 729, exemplified the once \u201cprevailing ideology.\u201d  As prime illustrations, the Court cited Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873);[Footnote 7]  Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412 (1908);[Footnote 8]  Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948);[Footnote 9] and Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961).[Footnote 10]  The Hibbs opinion contrasted Muller, Goesaert, and Hoyt with more recent opinions: Commencing in 1971, the Court had shown increasing awareness that traditional sex-based classifications confined or depressed women\u2019s opportunities.  538 U. S., at 728\u2013730.  Representative of the jurisprudential change, Hibbs cited Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971);[Footnote 11] Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677 (1973);[Footnote 12] Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190 (1976);[Footnote 13] and United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515 (1996).[Footnote 14]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gilbert is aberrational not simply because it placed outside Title VII disadvantageous treatment of pregnancy rooted in \u201cstereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of family duties,\u201d Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 730; Gilbert also advanced the strange notion that a benefits classification excluding some women (\u201cpregnant women\u201d) is not sex-based because other women are among the favored class (\u201cnonpregnant persons\u201d).[Footnote 15]  The very first Title VII sex-discrimination case heard by the Court, Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U. S. 542 (1971) (per curiam), however, rejected similar reasoning.  At issue in Phillips was an employer\u2019s refusal to hire mothers of pre-school-age children.  Phillips yielded a per curiam opinion recognizing that Title VII applies to classifications disadvantageous to some, but not most, women.  See, e.g., Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 416 F.\u00a02d 1257, 1262 (CA5 1969) (Brown, C.\u00a0J., dissenting from denial of en banc review) (\u201cA mother is still a woman.  And if she is denied work outright because she is a mother, it is because she is a woman.  Congress said that could no longer be done.\u201d); Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.\u00a02d 1194 (CA7) (refusal to employ married women violates Title VII), cert. denied, 404 U. S. 991 (1971).[Footnote 16]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grasping the connection Gilbert failed to make, a District Court opinion pre-Gilbert, Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 372 F.\u00a0Supp. 1146 (WD Pa. 1974), published this deft observation.  In response to an employer\u2019s argument that its disadvantageous maternity leave and pregnancy disability income protection policies were not based on sex, the court commented: \u201c[I]t might appear to the lay mind that we are treading on the brink of a precipice of absurdity.  Perhaps the admonition of Professor Thomas Reed Powell to his law students is apt; \u2018If you can think of something which is inextricably related to some other thing and not think of the other thing, you have a legal mind.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 1157.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress put the Court back on track in 1978 when it amended Title VII to repudiate Gilbert\u2019s holding and reasoning.  See Newport News, 462 U. S., at 678; California Fed., 479 U. S., at 284\u2013285; supra, at 4\u20135.[Footnote 17]  Congress\u2019 swift and strong repudiation of Gilbert, the Court today holds, does not warrant any redress for the plaintiffs in this case.  They must continue to experience the impact of their employer\u2019s discriminatory\u2014but, for a short time, Gilbert-blessed\u2014plan.  That outcome is far from inevitable.  It is at least reasonable to read the PDA to say, from and after the effective date of the Act, no woman\u2019s pension payments are to be diminished by the pretense that pregnancy-based discrimination displays no gender bias.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would construe the Act to embrace plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and would explicitly overrule Gilbert so that the decision can generate no more mischief.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.\n\u00a0The Court\u2019s opinion in Gilbert extended to Title VII reasoning earlier advanced in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484 (1974).  In that case, the Court upheld against an equal protection challenge California\u2019s disability insurance system, which excluded coverage for disabilities occasioned by normal pregnancy.  California\u2019s system, the Court noted, did not divide workers according to their sex; instead, it \u201cdivide[d] potential recipients into two groups\u2014pregnant women and nonpregnant persons.\u201d  Id., at 496\u2013497, n.\u00a020.\n\u00a0See Communications Workers of America v.

HULTEEN et\u00a0al.\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\nNo. 07\u2013543.\u2003Argued December 10, 2008\u2014Decided May 18, 2009\nPetitioner companies (collectively, AT&T) long based pension calculations on a seniority system that relied on years of service minus uncredited leave time, giving less retirement credit for pregnancy absences than for medical leave generally.  In response to the ruling in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, that such differential treatment of pregnancy leave was not sex-based discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress added the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to Title VII in 1978 to make it \u201cclear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions,\u201d Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 684.  On the PDA\u2019s effective date, AT&T replaced its old plan with the Anticipated Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit for pregnancy leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but did not make any retroactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel policies.  Each of the individual respondents therefore received less service credit for her pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would have for general disability leave, resulting in a reduction in her total employment term and, consequently, smaller AT&T pensions.  They, along with their union, also a respondent, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges alleging discrimination based on sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.  The EEOC issued each respondent (collectively, Hulteen) a determination letter finding reasonable cause to believe AT&T had discriminated and a right-to-sue letter.  Hulteen filed suit in the District Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit precedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that differentiated based on pregnancy.  The Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0An employer does not necessarily violate the PDA when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only pre-PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for medical leave generally.  Because AT&T\u2019s pension payments accord with a bona fide seniority system\u2019s terms, they are insulated from challenge under Title VII \u00a7703(h).  Pp.\u00a04\u201314. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0AT&T\u2019s benefit calculation rule is protected by \u00a7703(h), which provides: \u201c[I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation \u2026 pursuant to a bona fide seniority \u2026 system \u2026 provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of \u2026 sex.\u201d  In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 356, the Court held that a pre-Title VII seniority system that disproportionately advantaged white, as against minority, employees nevertheless exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory terms under \u00a7703(h), where the discrimination resulted from the employer\u2019s hiring practices and job assignments.  Because AT&T\u2019s system must also be viewed as bona fide, i.e., as a system having no discriminatory terms, \u00a7703(h) controls the result here, just as it did in Teamsters.  This Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, \u201can exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.\u201d  429 U. S., at 136.  The only way to conclude that \u00a7703(h) does not protect AT&T\u2019s system would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize AT&T\u2019s acts as having been illegal when done.  This is not a serious possibility.  Generally, there is \u201ca presumption against retroactivity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\u201d  Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272\u2013273.  There is no such clear intent here.  Section 706(e)(2)\u2014which details when \u201can unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose\u201d\u2014has no application because Gilbert unquestionably held that the feature of AT&T\u2019s seniority system at issue here was not discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so.  Nor can it be argued that because AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so was facially discriminatory at that time.  If a choice to rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination, \u00a7703(h) would never apply.  Finally, Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385\u2014in which a pre-Title VII compensation plan giving black employees less pay than whites was held to violate Title VII on its effective date\u2014is inapplicable because the Bazemore plan did not involve a seniority system subject to \u00a7703(h) and the employer there failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice when Title VII became law.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k), when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only prior to the PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy leave than for medical leave generally.  We hold there is no necessary violation; and the benefit calculation rule in this case is part of a bona fide seniority system under \u00a7703(h) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h), which insulates it from challenge.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since 1914, AT&T Corporation (then American Telephone & Telegraph Company) and its Bell System Operating Companies, including Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (hereinafter, collectively, AT&T),[Footnote 1] have provided pensions and other benefits based on a seniority system that relies upon an employee\u2019s term of employment, understood as the period of service at the company minus uncredited leave time.[Footnote 2]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, AT&T employees on \u201cdisability\u201d leave got full service credit for the entire periods of absence, but those who took \u201cpersonal\u201d leaves of absence received maximum service credit of 30 days.  Leave for pregnancy was treated as personal, not disability.  AT&T altered this practice in 1977 by adopting its Maternity Payment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant employees to disability benefits and service credit for up to six weeks of leave.  If the absence went beyond six weeks, however, it was treated as personal leave, with no further benefits or credit, whereas employees out on disability unrelated to pregnancy continued to receive full service credit for the duration of absence.  This differential treatment of pregnancy leave, under both the pre-1977 plan and the MPP, was lawful: in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court concluded that a disability benefit plan excluding disabilities related to pregnancy was not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e et seq.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing the PDA, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k), which superseded Gilbert so as to make it \u201cclear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medical conditions.\u201d  Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 684 (1983).  On April 29, 1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&T adopted its Anticipated Disability Plan which replaced the MPP and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on the same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabilities.  AT&T did not, however, make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit calculations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA personnel policies.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four of those women are named respondents in this case. Each of them received less service credit for pregnancy leave than she would have accrued on the same leave for disability: seven months less for Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.  Respondents Hulteen, Collet, and Snyder have retired from AT&T; respondent Porter has yet to.  If her total term of employment had not been decreased due to her pregnancy leave, each would be entitled to a greater pension benefit.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, each of the individual respondents and  respondent Communications Workers of America (CWA), the collective-bargaining representative for the majority of AT&T\u2019s nonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.  In 1998, the EEOC issued a Letter of Determination finding reasonable cause to believe that AT&T had discriminated against respondent Hulteen and \u201ca class of other similarly-situated female employees whose adjusted [commencement of service] date has been used to determine eligibility for a service or disability pension, the amount of pension benefits, and eligibility for certain other benefits and programs, including early retirement offerings.\u201d  App. 54\u201355.  The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to each named respondent and the CWA (collectively, Hulteen), and Hulteen filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On dueling motions for summary judgment, the District Court held itself bound by a prior Ninth Circuit decision, Pallas v. Pacific Bell, 940 F.\u00a02d 1324 (1991), which found a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that differentiated on the basis of pregnancy.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a\u2013122a.  The Circuit, en banc, affirmed and held that Pallas\u2019s conclusion that \u201ccalculation of service credit excluding time spent on pregnancy leave violates Title VII was, and is, correct.\u201d  498 F.\u00a03d 1001, 1003 (2007).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision directly conflicts with the holdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that reliance on a pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine pension benefits does not constitute a current violation of Title VII.  See Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm. v. Communication Workers of Am., 220 F.\u00a03d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no actionable Title VII violation given the existence of a bona fide seniority system); Leffman v. Sprint Corp., 481 F.\u00a03d 428 (CA6 2007) (characterizing claim as challenging the continuing effects of past discrimination rather than alleging a current Title VII violation).  We granted certiorari in order to resolve this split, 554 U. S. __ (2008), and now reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Title VII makes it an \u201cunlawful employment practice\u201d for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s \u2026 sex.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).  Generally, a claim under Title VII must be filed \u201cwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\u201d \u00a72000e\u20135(e)(1).  In this case, Hulteen has identified the challenged practice as applying the terms of AT&T\u2019s seniority system to calculate and pay pension benefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April 29, 1979.  She says the claim is timely because the old service credit differential for pregnancy leave was carried forward through the system\u2019s calculations so as to produce an effect in the amount of the benefit when payments began.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no question that the payment of pension benefits in this case is a function of a seniority system, given the fact that calculating benefits under the pension plan depends in part on an employee\u2019s term of employment.  As we have said, \u201c[a] \u2018seniority system\u2019 is a scheme that, alone or in tandem with non-\u2018seniority\u2019 criteria, allots to employees ever improving employment rights and benefits as their relative lengths of pertinent employment increase.\u201d California Brewers Assn. v. Bryant, 444 U. S. 598, 605\u2013606 (1980) (footnote omitted).  Hulteen is also undoubtedly correct that AT&T\u2019s personnel policies affecting the calculation of any employee\u2019s start date should be considered \u201cancillary rules\u201d and elements of the system, necessary for it to operate at all, being rules that \u201cdefine which passages of time will \u2018count\u2019 towards the accrual of seniority and which will not.\u201d  Id., at 607.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But contrary to Hulteen\u2019s position, establishing the continuity of a seniority system whose results depend in part on obsolete rules entailing disadvantage to once-pregnant employees does not resolve this case.  Although adopting a service credit rule unfavorable to those out on pregnancy leave would violate Title VII today, a seniority system does not necessarily violate the statute when it gives current effect to such rules that operated before the PDA.  \u201c[S]eniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII,\u201d Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U. S. 63, 81 (1977), reflecting Congress\u2019s understanding that their stability is valuable in its own right.  Hence, \u00a7703(h):\n\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority \u2026 system \u2026 provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin \u2026\u00a0.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h). \n\nBenefit differentials produced by a bona fide seniority-based pension plan are permitted unless they are \u201cthe result of an intention to discriminate.\u201d  Ibid.[Footnote 3]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977), advantages of a seniority system flowed disproportionately to white, as against minority, employees, because of an employer\u2019s prior discrimination in job assignments.  We recognized that this \u201cdisproportionate distribution of advantages does in a very real sense operate to freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices[,] [b]ut both the literal terms of \u00a7703(h) and the legislative history of Title VII demonstrate that Congress considered this very effect of many seniority systems and extended a measure of immunity to them.\u201d Id., at 350 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[T]he unmistakable purpose of \u00a7703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under Title VII.\u201d  Id., at 352.  The seniority system in Teamsters exemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory terms (the discrimination having occurred in executive action hiring employees and assigning jobs), so that the Court could conclude that the system \u201cdid not have its genesis in \u2026 discrimination, and \u2026 has been maintained free from any illegal purpose.\u201d  Id., at 356.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AT&T\u2019s system must also be viewed as bona fide, that is, as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with the consequence that subsection (h) controls the result here, just as in Teamsters.  It is true that in this case the pre-April 29, 1979 rule of differential treatment was an element of the seniority system itself; but it did not taint the system under the terms of subsection (h), because this Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, \u201can exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.\u201d  429 U. S., at 136.[Footnote 4]  Although the PDA would have made it discriminatory to continue the accrual policies of the old rule, AT&T amended that rule as of the effective date of the Act, April 29, 1979; the new one, treating pregnancy and other temporary disabilities the same way, remains a part of AT&T\u2019s seniority system today.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This account of litigation, legislation, and the evolution of the system\u2019s terms is the answer to Hulteen\u2019s argument that Teamsters supports her position.  She correctly points out that a \u201cseniority system that perpetuates the effects of pre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to discriminate entered into its very adoption,\u201d 431 U. S., at 346, n. 28, and she would characterize AT&T\u2019s seniority system as intentionally discriminatory, on the theory that the accrual rule for pregnancy leave was facially discriminatory from the start.  She claims further support from Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U. S. 187 (1991), in which we said that \u201cexplicit facial discrimination does not depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination,\u201d and that such facial discrimination is intentional discrimination even if not based on any underlying malevolence.  Id., at 199.  Hulteen accordingly claims that the superseded differential affecting current benefits was, and remains, \u201cdiscriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,\u201d Brief for Respondents 18.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Automobile Workers is not on point.  The policy in that case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with lead exposure unless they could show themselves incapable of child bearing, was put in place after the PDA became law and under its terms was facially discriminatory.  In this case, however, AT&T\u2019s intent when it adopted the pregnancy leave rule (before the PDA) was to give differential treatment that as a matter of law, as Gilbert held, was not gender-based discrimination.  Because AT&T\u2019s differential accrual rule was therefore a permissible differentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing in the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h) bona fide requirement.  The consequence is that subsection (h) is as applicable here as it was in Teamsters, and the calculations of credited service that determine pensions are the results of a permissibly different standard under subsection (h) today.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only way to conclude here that the subsection would not support the application of AT&T\u2019s system would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize the acts as having been illegal when done, contra Gilbert.[Footnote 6]  But this is not a serious possibility.  As we have said,\n\u201c[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations.  Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.\u201d  Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272\u2013273 (1994).\n\nThere is no such clear intent here, indeed, no indication at all that Congress had retroactive application in mind; the evidence points the other way.  Congress provided for the PDA to take effect on the date of enactment, except in its application to certain benefit programs, as to which effectiveness was held back 180 days.  Act of Oct. 31, 1978, \u00a72(b), 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k) (1979 ed.).  The House Report adverted to these benefit schemes:\n\u201cAs the Gilbert decision permits employers to exclude pregnancy-related coverage from employee benefit plans, [the bill] provides for [a] transition period of 180 days to allow employees [sic] to comply with the explicit provisions of this amendment. It is the committee\u2019s intention to provide for an orderly and equitable transition, with the least disruption for employers and employees, consistent with the purposes of the bill.\u201d  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95\u2013948, p. 8 (1978).\n\nThis is the language of prospective intent, not retrospective revision.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hulteen argues that she nonetheless has a challenge to AT&T\u2019s current payment of pension benefits under \u00a7706(e)(2) of Title VII, believing (again mistakenly) that this subsection affects the validity of any arrangement predating the PDA that would be facially discriminatory if instituted today.  Brief for Respondents 27\u201329.  Section 706(e)(2) provides that\n\u201can unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter (whether or not that discriminatory purpose is apparent on the face of the seniority provision), when the seniority system is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to the seniority system, or when a person aggrieved is injured by the application of the seniority system or provision of the system.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20135(e)(2).\n\nBut, as the text makes clear, this subsection determines the moments at which a seniority system violates Title VII only if it is a system \u201cadopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter.\u201d  As discussed above, the Court has unquestionably held that the feature of AT&T\u2019s seniority system at issue was not discriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so in violation of this subchapter.  That leaves \u00a7706(e)(2) without any application here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is equally unsound for Hulteen to argue that when she retired AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to do so facially discriminatory at that time.[Footnote 7]  If a choice to rely on a favorable statute turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination, subsection (h) would never apply.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hulteen\u2019s remaining argument (as of the time the case was submitted to us) is that our decision in Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (1986) (per curiam), is on her side.  In Bazemore, black employees of the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, who received less pay than comparable whites under a differential compensation plan extending back to pre-Title VII segregation, brought suit in 1971 claiming that pay disparities persisted.  Id., at 389\u2013391.  We concluded that \u201c[a] pattern or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became a violation upon Title VII\u2019s effective date, and to the extent an employer continued to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that statute.\u201d  Id., at 395.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bazemore has nothing to say here.  To begin with, it did not involve a seniority system subject to subsection (h); rather, the employer in Bazemore had a racially based pay structure under which black employees were paid less than white employees.  Further, after Title VII became law, the employer failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice, even though the new statute had turned what once was legally permissible into something unlawful.  Bazemore would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&T continued to apply an unfavorable credit differential for pregnancy leave simply because it had begun to do that before the PDA.  AT&T\u2019s system, by contrast, provides future benefits based on past, completed events, that were entirely lawful at the time they occurred.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have accepted supplemental briefing after the argument on the possible effect on this case of the recent amendment to \u00a7706(e) of Title VII, adopted in response to Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618 (2007), and dealing specifically with discrimination in compensation:\n\u201cFor purposes of this section, an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.\u201d Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111\u20132, \u00a73(A), 123 Stat. 5\u20136.\n\nHulteen argues that payment of the pension benefits at issue in this case marks the moment at which she \u201cis affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice,\u201d and she reads the statute as providing that such a \u201cdecision or other practice\u201d may not be applied to her disadvantage.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the answer to this claim is essentially the same as the answer to Hulteen\u2019s argument that \u00a7706(e)(2) helps her, supra, at 11\u201312.  For the reasons already discussed, AT&T\u2019s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service credit for pregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with the consequence that Hulteen has not been \u201caffected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice.\u201d  \u00a73(A), 123 Stat. 6. \nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bona fide seniority systems allow, among other\nthings, for predictable financial consequences, both for the employer who pays the bill and for the employee who gets the benefit.  Cf. Central Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Heinz, 541 U. S. 739, 743 (2004) (noting that the central feature of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001 et seq., is its \u201cobject of protecting employees\u2019 justified expectations of receiving the benefits their employers promise them\u201d).  As \u00a7703(h) demonstrates, Congress recognized the salience of these reliance interests and, where not based upon or resulting from an intention to discriminate, gave them protection.  Because the seniority system run by AT&T is bona fide, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0In 1982, a consent decree and Modified Final Judgment (MFJ) were entered to resolve the Government\u2019s antitrust suit against American Telephone & Telegraph Company.  The MFJ resulted in the break-up of American Telephone & Telegraph and the divestiture of the local Bell System Operating Companies, including Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (PT&T).  Many employees of the former Bell System Operating Companies became employees of the new AT&T Corporation.  The Plan of Reorganization, approved by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, United States v. Western Elec. Co., 569 F.\u00a0Supp. 1057, aff\u2019d sub\u00a0nom. California v. United States, 464 U. S. 1013 (1983), provided that \u201call employees will carry with them all pre-divestiture Bell System service regardless of the organizational unit or corporation by which they are employed immediately after divestiture.\u201d App. 54.  Respondents in this case were employed at PT&T.  After the divestiture of the Bell Operating Companies in 1984, these women became employees of AT&T Corporation and their service calculations, as computed by PT&T under its accrual rules, were carried over to AT&T Corporation.\n\u00a0AT&T\u2019s calculation of a term of employment is a more complicated endeavor, requiring the creation and maintenance of an individual \u201cstart date\u201d for each employee, which is adjusted based on the relevant leave policy.\n\u00a0Section 701(k) of Title VII provides that \u201cwomen affected by pregnancy, \u2026 shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work, and nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit otherwise.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k).  Hulteen contends that, in light of this language, \u00a7703(h) does not apply at all to claims of fringe-benefit discrimination under the PDA.  We cannot agree.  Hulteen\u2019s reading would result in the odd scenario that pregnancy discrimination, alone among all categories of discrimination (race, color, religion, other sex-based claims, and national origin), would receive dispensation from the general application of subsection (h).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A better explanation is that \u00a7701(k) refers only to the final sentence of \u00a7703(h), which reads that \u201c[i]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206(d) of title 29.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e\u20132(h).  This final sentence of subsection (h), referred to as the Bennett Amendment, served to reconcile the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7206(d), with Title VII.  See County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U. S. 161, 194 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court had concluded that the amendment permitted wage discrimination based on pregnancy.  Id., at 144\u2013145.  By adding the language, \u201cnothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit otherwise,\u201d to the PDA, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e(k), Congress wanted to ensure that, in addition to replacing Gilbert with a rule that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is sex discrimination, it foreclosed the possibility that this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Bennett Amendment could be construed, going forward, to permit wage discrimination based on pregnancy.\n\u00a0Gilbert recognized that differential treatment could still represent intentionally discriminatory treatment if pretextual, 429 U. S., at 136, and that a forbidden discriminatory effect could result if a disability-benefits plan produced overall preferential treatment for one sex, id., at 138.  Neither theory is advanced here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U. S. 136 (1977), we reaffirmed our holding in Gilbert that Title VII \u201cdid not require that greater economic benefits be paid to one sex or the other \u2018because of their differing roles in \u201cthe scheme of human existence.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d Id., at 142 (quoting Gilbert, supra, at 139, n. 17).  But we noted that Gilbert\u2019s holding did not extend to \u201cpermit an employer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their different role.\u201d Satty, supra, at 142.  Cancellation of benefits previously accrued, therefore, was considered facially violative at the time, but such a situation is not presented here.\n\u00a0Although certain circuit courts had previously concluded that treating pregnancy leave less favorably than other disability leave constituted sex discrimination under Title VII, this Court in Gilbert clearly rejected that conclusion, 429 U. S., at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see also id., at 162 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Gilbert declared the meaning and scope of sex discrimination under Title VII and held that previous views to the contrary were wrong as a matter of law.  And \u201c[a] judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction.\u201d  Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 312\u2013313 (1994); see also id., at 313, n. 12.  It is therefore to no avail to argue that the pregnancy leave cap was unlawful before Gilbert and that the PDA returned the law to its prior state.  \n\u00a0In so saying, we assume that \u00a7701(k) has no application, as explained in footnote 3, supra.  Cf. post, at 4\u20136 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). \n\u00a0To the extent Hulteen means to claim, as a factual matter, that the accrual rule was merely advisory, requiring a fresh choice to apply it in the benefit context, she points to nothing in the record supporting such a proposition."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/701/"}, {"ID": 55552, "name": "Locke v.

The U.S. Department of the Interior, acting at the tribe's request, moved to take the land into federal trust, thereby placing it largely under federal and tribal control, in 1998. However, Rhode Island officials opposed the move, claiming that the Department of the Interior lacked the proper authority because the Narragansett tribe was not recognized until nearly 50 years after the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act took effect. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island upheld the action, stating that Rhode Island was taking an unnecessarily narrow view of the law.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the district court's decision and approved of its reasoning. In seeking Supreme Court review to determine whether the time of tribal recognition should be dispositive on this issue, Rhode Island noted that \"the future allocation of civil and criminal jurisdiction between states and tribes over a potentially unlimited amount of land hangs in the balance.\"</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the federal government have the ability to take land into trust for American Indian tribes recognized after the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court reversed the First Circuit holding that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 did not apply to tribes not recognized at the time of the statute's creation. Therefore, the Indian Reorganization Act did not authorize the Secretary of the Interior to act on behalf of the Narrangansett Tribe as trustee. With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that the statute unambiguously referred only to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction in 1934, and therefore did not apply to the Narrangansett Tribe.</p>\n<p>Justice Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion qualifying his assent to the majority opinion. In part, he argued that the statute was not \"unambiguous\", but through contextual analysis, the statute referred only to those tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934. Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, also wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part. He departed from the majority opinion by arguing that the case should have been remanded for the Narrangansett Tribe to pursue an alternative legal theory. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented arguing that the Narrangansett Tribe was an Indian Tribe under the meaning of the statute, though not specified by name, and therefore the Secretary of the Interior should be allowed to act on its behalf.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 43165, "name": "Theodore B.

The state officials argued that the redistricting plan was required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), stating that the minority group in question, comprised of African-American North Carolina citizens, was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority under the terms of the VRA. The North Carolina Superior Court agreed with the state officials and entered summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p>The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed on appeal, holding that the minority group did not comprise a numerical majority of citizens and, therefore, redistricting was not required by the VRA. Because the redistricting plan did not meet the conditions of the VRA, the court said, it had to comply with certain terms of North Carolina's Constitution setting a minimum county population for redistricting. The court found that the county did not meet this requirement, and declared the plan unlawful.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is a North Carolina redistricting plan in a county lacking a numerical majority of minority citizens required by the Voting Rights of Act of 1965 and, therefore, exempt from complying with the conditions of the North Carolina Constitution.</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court affirmed the North Carolina Supreme Court holding that the VRA does not require state officials to redraw election district lines to allow a racial minority group to feasibly join with crossover voters to elect the minority's candidate choice when the racial minority group would make up less than 50 percent of the voting population in the redrawn district. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the plurality and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Court, relying on its decision in <em>Gingles</em>, stated that the VRA allows redistricting only when a geographically compact group of minority voters could form a majority in the redrawn election district. The Court reasoned that this requirement was not satisfied here as the minority group in the redrawn district comprised a mere 39 percent of the voting population.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin G. Scalia, concurred only in the judgment. He disagreed with the <em>Gingles</em> framework for analyzing vote dilution claims arguing it had no basis in the language of the VRA. Justice David H. Souter dissented and was joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer. He disagreed with the majority's holding, arguing that a district may be redrawn so long as a cohesive minority population is large enough to elect its chosen candidate when combined with crossover voters. Justice Ginsburg also wrote a separate dissenting opinion, encouraging Congress to remedy what she viewed as the Court's misinterpretation of the VRA. Justice Breyer also wrote a separate dissenting opinion, criticizing the plurality's reliance on a 50 percent threshold as too simplistic because it fails to account for the realities of how people actually vote.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 18476, "name": "Christopher G.

I write separately in light of the plurality\u2019s claim that a bright-line 50% rule (used as a Gingles gateway) serves administrative objectives.  In the plurality\u2019s view, that rule amounts to a relatively simple administrative device that will help separate at the outset those cases that are more likely meritorious from those that are not.  Even were that objective as critically important as the plurality believes, however, it is not difficult to find other numerical gateway rules that would work better.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assume that a basic purpose of a gateway number is to separate (1) districts where a minority group can \u201celect representatives of their choice,\u201d from (2) districts where the minority, because of the need to obtain majority crossover votes, can only \u201celect representatives\u201d that are consensus candidates.  42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 445 (2006) (plurality opinion).  At first blush, one might think that a 50% rule will work in this respect.  After all, if a 50% minority population votes as a bloc, can it not always elect the candidate of its choice?  And if a minority population constitutes less than 50% of a district, is not any candidate elected from that district always a consensus choice of minority and majority voters?  The realities of voting behavior, however, make clear that the answer to both these questions is \u201cno.\u201d  See, e.g., Brief for Nathaniel Persily et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5\u20136.  (\u201cFifty percent is seen as a magic number by some because under conditions of complete racial polarization and equal rates of voting eligibility, registration, and turnout, the minority community will be able to elect its candidate of choice.  In practice, such extreme conditions are never present. . . . [S]ome districts must be more than 50% minority, while others can be less than 50% minority, in order for the minority community to have an equal opportunity to elect its candidate of choice\u201d (emphasis added)); see also ante, at 8 (Souter, J., dissenting).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No voting group is 100% cohesive.  Except in districts with overwhelming minority populations, some crossover votes are often necessary.  The question is how likely it is that the need for crossover votes will force a minority to reject its \u201cpreferred choice\u201d in favor of a \u201cconsensus candidate.\u201d  A 50% number does not even try to answer that question.  To the contrary, it includes, say 51% minority districts, where imperfect cohesion may, in context, prevent election of the \u201cminority-preferred\u201d candidate, while it excludes, say, 45% districts where a smaller but more cohesive minority can, with the help of a small and reliable majority crossover vote, elect its preferred candidate.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why not use a numerical gateway rule that looks more directly at the relevant question: Is the minority bloc large enough, is it cohesive enough, is the necessary majority crossover vote small enough, so that the minority (tending to vote cohesively) can likely vote its preferred candidate (rather than a consensus candidate) into office?  See ante, at 7 (Souter, J., dissenting) (\u201c[E]mpirical studies confirm[] that . . . minority groups\u201d constituting less than 50% of the voting population \u201cregularly elect their preferred candidates with the help of modest crossover by members of the majority\u201d); see also Pildes, Is Voting-Rights Law Now at War With Itself? Social Science and Voting Rights in the 2000s, 80 N. C. L. Rev. 1517, 1529\u20131535 (2002) (reviewing studies showing small but reliable crossover voting by whites in districts where minority voters have demonstrated the ability to elect their preferred candidates without constituting 50% of the population in that district).  We can likely find a reasonably administrable mathematical formula more directly tied to the factors in question.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take a possible example: Suppose we pick a numerical ratio that requires the minority voting age population to be twice as large as the percentage of majority crossover votes needed to elect the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.  We would calculate the latter (the percentage of majority crossover votes the minority voters need) to take account of both the percentage of minority voting age population in the district and the cohesiveness with which they vote.  Thus, if minority voters account for 45% of the voters in a district and 89% of those voters tend to vote cohesively as a group, then the minority needs a crossover vote of about 20% of the majority voters to elect its preferred candidate.  (Such a district with 100 voters would have 45 minority voters and 55 majority voters; 40 minority voters would vote for the minority group\u2019s preferred candidate at election time; the minority voters would need 11 more votes to elect their preferred candidate; and 11 is about 20% of the majority\u2019s 55.)  The larger the minority population, the greater its cohesiveness, and thus the smaller the crossover vote needed to assure success, the greater the likelihood that the minority can elect its preferred candidate and the smaller the likelihood that the cohesive minority, in order to find the needed majority crossover vote, must support a consensus, rather than its preferred, candidate.   \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reflecting the reality that minority voters can elect the candidate of their choice when they constitute less than 50% of a district by relying on a small majority crossover vote, this approach is in no way contradictory, or even in tension with, the third Gingles requirement.  Since Gingles itself, we have acknowledged that the requirement of majority-bloc voting can be satisfied even when some small number of majority voters crossover to support a minority-preferred candidate.   See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 59 (1986) (finding majority-bloc voting where the majority group supported African-American candidates in the general election at a rate of between 26% and 49%, with an average support of one-third).  Given the difficulty of obtaining totally accurate statistics about cohesion, or even voting age population, the district courts should administer the numerical ratio flexibly, opening (or closing) the Gingles gate (in light of the probable merits of a case) where only small variances are at issue (e.g., where the minority group is 39% instead of 40% of a district).  But the same is true with a 50% number (e.g., where the minority group is 49% instead of 50% of a district).  See, e.g., Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not claim that the 2-to-1 ratio is a perfect rule; I claim only that it is better than the plurality\u2019s 50% rule.  After all, unlike 50%, a 2-to-1 ratio (of voting age minority population to necessary non-minority crossover votes) focuses directly upon the problem at hand, better reflects voting realities, and consequently far better separates at the gateway likely sheep from likely goats.  See Gingles, supra, at 45 (The Section 2 inquiry depends on a \u201c\u00a0\u2018functional\u2019 view of the political process\u201d and \u201c\u00a0\u2018a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  (quoting S. Rep. No. 97\u2013417, p.\u00a030, and n. 120 (1982)); Gingles, supra, at 94\u201395 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c[T]here is no indication that Congress intended to mandate a single, universally applicable standard for measuring undiluted minority voting strength, regardless of local conditions . . . \u201d).  In most cases, the 50% rule and the 2-to-1 rule would have roughly similar effects.  Most districts where the minority voting age population is greater than 50% will almost always satisfy the 2-to-1 rule; and most districts where the minority population is below 40% will almost never satisfy the 2-to-1 rule.  But in districts with minority voting age populations that range from 40% to 50%, the divergent approaches of the two standards can make a critical difference\u2014as well they should. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a word, Justice Souter well explains why the majority\u2019s test is ill suited to the statute\u2019s objectives.  I add that the test the majority adopts is ill suited to its own administrative ends.  Better gateway tests, if needed, can be found. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.

DWIGHT\nSTRICKLAND et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina\n[March 9, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question in this case is whether a minority with under 50% of the voting population of a proposed voting district can ever qualify under \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act  of 1965 (VRA) as residents of a putative district whose minority voters would have an opportunity \u201cto elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.).  If the answer is no, minority voters in such a district will have no right to claim relief under \u00a72 from a statewide districting scheme that dilutes minority voting rights.  I would hold that the answer in law as well as in fact is sometimes yes: a district may be a minority-opportunity district so long as a cohesive minority population is large enough to elect its chosen candidate when combined with a reliable number of crossover voters from an otherwise polarized majority.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the plurality\u2019s view, only a district with a minority population making up 50% or more of the citizen voting age population (CVAP) can provide a remedy to minority voters lacking an opportunity \u201cto elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  This is incorrect as a factual matter if the statutory phrase is given its natural meaning; minority voters in districts with minority populations under 50% routinely \u201celect representatives of their choice.\u201d  The effects of the plurality\u2019s unwillingness to face this fact are disturbing by any measure and flatly at odds with the obvious purpose of the Act.  If districts with minority populations under 50% can never count as minority-opportunity districts to remedy a violation of the States\u2019 obligation to provide equal electoral opportunity under \u00a72, States will be required under the plurality\u2019s rule to pack black voters into additional majority-minority districts, contracting the number of districts where racial minorities are having success in transcending racial divisions in securing their preferred representation.  The object of the Voting Rights Act will now be promoting racial blocs, and the role of race in districting decisions as a proxy for political identification will be heightened by any measure.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recalling the basic premises of vote-dilution claims under \u00a72 will show just how far astray the plurality has gone.  Section 2 of the VRA prohibits districting practices that \u201cresul[t] in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(a).  A denial or abridgment is established if, \u201cbased on the totality of circumstances,\u201d it is shown that members of a racial minority \u201chave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  \u00a71973(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since \u00a72 was amended in 1982, 96 Stat. 134, we have read it to prohibit practices that result in \u201cvote dilution,\u201d see Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), understood as distributing politically cohesive minority voters through voting districts in ways that reduce their potential strength.  See id., at 47\u201348.  There are two classic patterns.  Where voting is racially polarized, a districting plan can systemically discount the minority vote either \u201cby the dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters\u201d or from \u201cthe concentration of blacks into districts where they constitute an excessive majority,\u201d so as to eliminate their influence in neighboring districts.  Id., at 46, n. 11.  Treating dilution as a remediable harm recognizes that \u00a72 protects not merely the right of minority voters to put ballots in a box, but to claim a fair number of districts in which their votes can be effective.  See id., at 47.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three points follow.  First, to speak of a fair chance to get the representation desired, there must be an identifiable baseline for measuring a group\u2019s voting strength.  Id., at 88 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cIn order to evaluate a claim that a particular multimember district or single-member district has diluted the minority group\u2019s voting strength to a degree that violates \u00a72, \u2026 it is \u2026 necessary to construct a measure of \u2018undiluted\u2019 minority voting strength\u201d).  Several baselines can be imagined; one could, for example, compare a minority\u2019s voting strength under a particular districting plan with the maximum strength possible under any alternative.[Footnote 1]  Not surprisingly, we have conclusively rejected this approach; the VRA was passed to guarantee minority voters a fair game, not a killing.  See Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1016\u20131017 (1994). We have held that the better baseline for measuring opportunity to elect under \u00a72, although not dispositive, is the minority\u2019s rough proportion of the relevant population.  Id., at 1013\u20131023.  Thus, in assessing \u00a72 claims under a totality of the circumstances, including the facts of history and geography, the starting point is a comparison of the number of districts where minority voters can elect their chosen candidate with the group\u2019s population percentage.  Ibid; see also League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 436 (2006) (LULAC) (\u201cWe proceed now to the totality of the circumstances, and first to the proportionality inquiry, comparing the percentage of total districts that are [minority] opportunity districts with the [minority] share of the citizen voting-age population\u201d).[Footnote 2]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the significance of proportionality means that a \u00a72 claim must be assessed by looking at the overall effect of a multidistrict plan.  A State with one congressional seat cannot dilute a minority\u2019s congressional vote, and only the systemic submergence of minority votes where a number of single-member districts could be drawn can be treated as harm under \u00a72.  So a \u00a72 complaint must look to an entire districting plan (normally, statewide), alleging that the challenged plan creates an insufficient number of minority-opportunity districts in the territory as a whole.  See id., at 436\u2013437.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, while a \u00a72 violation ultimately results from the dilutive effect of a districting plan as a whole, a \u00a72 plaintiff must also be able to place himself in a reasonably compact district that could have been drawn to improve upon the plan actually selected.  See, e.g., De Grandy, supra, at 1001\u20131002.  That is, a plaintiff must show both an overall deficiency and a personal injury open to redress.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our first essay at understanding these features of statutory vote dilution was Thornburg v. Gingles, which asked whether a multimember district plan for choosing representatives by at-large voting deprived minority voters of an equal opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.  In answering, we set three now-familiar conditions that a \u00a72 claim must meet at the threshold before a court will analyze it under the totality of circumstances:\n\u201cFirst, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\u2026\u00a0. Second, the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive\u2026\u00a0. Third, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it \u2026 usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d  478 U. S., at 50\u201351.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we have emphasized over and over, the Gingles conditions do not state the ultimate standard under \u00a72, nor could they, since the totality of the circumstances standard has been set explicitly by Congress.  See LULAC, supra, at 425\u2013426; De Grandy, supra, at 1011.  Instead, each condition serves as a gatekeeper, ensuring that a plaintiff who proceeds to plenary review has a real chance to show a redressable violation of the ultimate \u00a72 standard.  The third condition, majority racial bloc voting, is necessary to establish the premise of vote-dilution claims: that the minority as a whole is placed at a disadvantage owing to race, not the happenstance of independent politics.  Gingles, 478 U. S., at 51.  The second, minority cohesion, is there to show that minority voters will vote together to elect a distinct representative of choice.  Ibid.  And the first, a large and geographically compact minority population, is the condition for demonstrating that a dilutive plan injures the \u00a72 plaintiffs by failing to draw an available remedial district that would give them a chance to elect their chosen candidate.  Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40\u201341 (1993); Gingles, supra, at 50.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though this case arose under the Constitution of North Carolina, the dispositive issue is one of federal statutory law: whether a district with a minority population under 50%, but large enough to elect its chosen candidate with the help of majority voters disposed to support the minority favorite, can ever count as a district where minority voters have the opportunity \u201cto elect representatives of their choice\u201d for purposes of \u00a72.  I think it clear from the nature of a vote-dilution claim and the text of \u00a72 that the answer must be yes.  There is nothing in the statutory text to suggest that Congress meant to protect minority opportunity to elect solely by the creation of majority-minority districts.  See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 155 (1993) (\u201c[Section 2] says nothing about majority-minority districts\u201d).  On the contrary, \u00a72 \u201cfocuses exclusively on the consequences of apportionment,\u201d ibid., as Congress made clear when it explicitly prescribed the ultimate functional approach: a totality of the circumstances test.  See 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (\u201cA violation \u2026 is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown \u2026\u201d).  And a functional analysis leaves no doubt that crossover districts vindicate the interest expressly protected by \u00a72: the opportunity to elect a desired representative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been apparent from the moment the Court first took up \u00a72 that no reason exists in the statute to treat a crossover district as a less legitimate remedy for dilution than a majority-minority one (let alone to rule it out).  See Gingles, supra, at 90, n.\u00a01 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c[I]f a minority group that is not large enough to constitute a voting majority in a single-member district can show that white support would probably \u2026 enable the election of the candidates its members prefer, that minority group would appear to have demonstrated that, at least under this measure of its voting strength, it would be able to elect some candidates of its choice\u201d); see also Pildes, Is Voting-Rights Law Now at War with Itself? Social Science and Voting Rights in the 2000s, 80 N.\u00a0C. L.\u00a0Rev. 1517, 1553 (2002) (hereinafter Pildes) (\u201cWhat should be so magical, then, about whether there are enough black voters to become a formal majority so that a conventional \u2018safe\u2019 district can be created?  If a safe and a coalition district have the same probability of electing a black candidate, are they not functionally identical, by definition, with respect to electing such candidates?\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As these earlier comments as much as say, whether a district with a minority population under 50% of CVAP may redress a violation of \u00a72 is a question of fact with an obvious answer: of course minority voters constituting less than 50% of the voting population can have an opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice, as amply shown by empirical studies confirming that such minority groups regularly elect their preferred candidates with the help of modest crossover by members of the majority.  See, e.g., id., at 1531\u20131534, 1538.  The North Carolina Supreme Court for example, determined that voting districts with a black voting age population of as little as 38.37% have an opportunity to elect black candidates, Pender Cty. v. Bartlett, 361 N.\u00a0C. 491, 494\u2013495, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d 364, 366\u2013367 (2007), a factual finding that has gone unchallenged and is well supported by electoral results in North Carolina.  Of the nine House districts in which blacks make up more than 50% of the voting age population (VAP), all but two elected a black representative in the 2004 election.  See App. 109.  Of the 12 additional House districts in which blacks are over 39% of the VAP, all but one elected a black representative in the 2004 election.  Ibid. It would surely surprise legislators in North Carolina to suggest that black voters in these 12 districts cannot possibly have an opportunity to \u201celect [the] representatives of their choice.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is of course true that the threshold population sufficient to provide minority voters with an opportunity to elect their candidates of choice is elastic, and the proportions will likely shift in the future, as they have in the past.  See Pildes 1527\u20131532 (explaining that blacks in the 1980s required well over 50% of the population in a district to elect the candidates of their choice, but that this number has gradually fallen to well below 50%); id., at 1527, n.\u00a026 (stating that some courts went so far as to refer to 65% \u201cas a \u2018rule of thumb\u2019 for the black population required to constitute a safe district\u201d).  That is, racial polarization has declined, and if it continues downward the first Gingles condition will get easier to satisfy.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this is no reason to create an arbitrary threshold; the functional approach will continue to allow dismissal of claims for districts with minority populations too small to demonstrate an ability to elect, and with \u201ccrossovers\u201d too numerous to allow an inference of vote dilution in the first place.  No one, for example, would argue based on the record of experience in this case that a district with a 25% black population would meet the first Gingles condition.  And the third Gingles requirement, majority-bloc voting, may well provide an analytical limit to claims based on crossover districts.  See LULAC, 548 U. S., at 490, n. 8 (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting the interrelationship of the first and third Gingles factors); see also post, at 1\u20135 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (looking to the third Gingles condition to suggest a mathematical limit to the minority population necessary for a cognizable crossover district).  But whatever this limit may be, we have no need to set it here, since the respondent state officials have stipulated to majority-bloc voting, App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a.  In sum, \u00a72 addresses voting realities, and for practical purposes a 39%-minority district in which we know minorities have the potential to elect their preferred candidate is every bit as good as a 50%-minority district.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, a crossover district is better.  Recognizing crossover districts has the value of giving States greater flexibility to draw districting plans with a fair number of minority-opportunity districts, and this in turn allows for a beneficent reduction in the number of majority-minority districts with their \u201cquintessentially race-conscious calculus,\u201d De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1020, thereby moderating reliance on race as an exclusive determinant in districting decisions, cf. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993).  See also Pildes 1547\u20131548 (\u201cIn contrast to the Court\u2019s concerns with bizarrely designed safe districts, it is hard to see how coalitional districts could \u2018convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial.\u2019\u00a0\u2026 Coalitional districts would seem to encourage and require a kind of integrative, cross-racial political alliance that might be thought consistent with, even the very ideal of, both the VRA and the U. S. Constitution\u201d (quoting Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 980 (1996))).  A crossover is thus superior to a majority-minority district precisely because it requires polarized factions to break out of the mold and form the coalitions that discourage racial divisions.\nIII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality\u2019s contrary conclusion that \u00a72 does not recognize a crossover claim is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of vote-dilution claims, a mistake epitomized in the following assessment of the crossover district in question:\n\u201c[B]ecause they form only 39 percent of the voting-age population in District 18, African-Americans standing alone have no better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than does any other group of voters with the same relative voting strength [in District 18].\u201d  Ante, at 9\u201310.\n\nSee also ante, at 16 (\u201c[In crossover districts,] minority voters have the same opportunity to elect their candidate as any other political group with the same relative voting strength\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The claim that another political group in a particular district might have the same relative voting strength as the minority if it had the same share of the population takes the form of a tautology: the plurality simply looks to one district and says that a 39% group of blacks is no worse off than a 39% group of whites would be.  This statement might be true, or it might not be, and standing alone it demonstrates nothing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the two 39% groups were assumed to be comparable in fact because they will attract sufficient crossover (and so should be credited with satisfying the first Gingles condition), neither of them could prove a \u00a72 violation without looking beyond the 39% district and showing a disproportionately small potential for success in the State\u2019s overall configuration of districts.  As this Court has explained before, the ultimate question in a \u00a72 case (that is, whether the minority group in question is being denied an equal opportunity to participate and elect) can be answered only by examining the broader pattern of districts to see whether the minority is being denied a roughly proportionate opportunity.  See LULAC, 548 U. S., at 436\u2013437.  Hence, saying one group\u2019s 39% equals another\u2019s, even if true in particular districts where facts are known, does not mean that either, both, or neither group could show a \u00a72 violation.  The plurality simply fails to grasp that an alleged \u00a72 violation can only be proved or disproved by looking statewide.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality\u2019s more specific justifications for its counterfactual position are no more supportable than its 39% tautology.\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality seems to suggest that our prior cases somehow require its conclusion that a minority population under 50% will never support a \u00a72 remedy, emphasizing that Gingles spoke of a majority and referred to the requirement that minority voters have \u201c\u00a0\u2018the potential to elect\u2019\u00a0\u201d their chosen representatives.  Ante, at 10 (quoting, Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50, n.\u00a017).  It is hard to know what to make of this point since the plurality also concedes that we have explicitly and repeatedly reserved decision on today\u2019s question.  See LULAC, supra, at 443 (plurality opinion); De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1009; Voinovich, 507 U. S., at 154; Growe, 507 U. S., at 41, n.\u00a05; Gingles, supra, at 46\u201347, n. 12.  In fact, in our more recent cases applying \u00a72, Court majorities have formulated the first Gingles prong in a way more consistent with a functional approach.  See LULAC, supra, at 430 (\u201c[I]n the context of a challenge to the drawing of district lines, \u2018the first Gingles condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting De Grandy, supra, at 1008)).  These Court majorities get short shrift from today\u2019s plurality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, even if we ignored Gingles\u2019s reservation of today\u2019s question and looked to Gingles\u2019s \u201cpotential to elect\u201d as if it were statutory text, I fail to see how that phrase dictates that a minority\u2019s ability to compete must be singlehanded in order to count under \u00a72.  As explained already, a crossover district serves the same interest in obtaining representation as a majority-minority district; the potential of 45% with a 6% crossover promises the same result as 51% with no crossover, and there is nothing in the logic of \u00a72 to allow a distinction between the two types of district.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the plurality\u2019s distinction is artificial on its own terms.  In the past, when black voter registration and black voter turnout were relatively low, even black voters with 55% of a district\u2019s CVAP would have had to rely on crossover voters to elect their candidate of choice. See Pildes 1527\u20131528.  But no one on this Court (and, so far as I am aware, any other court addressing it) ever suggested that reliance on crossover voting in such a district rendered minority success any less significant under \u00a72, or meant that the district failed to satisfy the first Gingles factor.  Nor would it be any answer to say that black voters in such a district, assuming unrealistic voter turnout, theoretically had the \u201cpotential\u201d to elect their candidate without crossover support; that would be about as relevant as arguing in the abstract that a black CVAP of 45% is potentially successful, on the assumption that black voters could turn out en masse to elect the candidate of their choice without reliance on crossovers if enough majority voters stay home.\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality is also concerned that recognizing the \u201cpotential\u201d of anything under 50% would entail an exponential expansion of special minority districting; the plurality goes so far as to suggest that recognizing crossover districts as possible minority-opportunity districts would inherently \u201centitl[e] minority groups to the maximum possible voting strength.\u201d  Ante, at 11.  But this conclusion again reflects a confusion of the gatekeeping function of the Gingles conditions with the ultimate test for relief under \u00a72.  See ante, at 9\u201310 (\u201cAfrican-Americans standing alone have no better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than does any other group of voters with the same relative voting strength\u201d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As already explained, supra, at 5\u20136, the mere fact that all threshold Gingles conditions could be met and a district could be drawn with a minority population sufficiently large to elect the candidate of its choice does not require drawing such a district.  This case simply is about the first Gingles condition, not about the number of minority-opportunity districts needed under \u00a72, and accepting Bartlett\u2019s position would in no way imply an obligation to maximize districts with minority voter potential.  Under any interpretation of the first Gingles factor, the State must draw districts in a way that provides minority voters with a fair number of districts in which they have an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice; the only question here is which districts will count toward that total.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality\u2019s fear of maximization finds a parallel in the concern that treating crossover districts as minority-opportunity districts would \u201ccreate serious tension\u201d with the third Gingles prerequisite of majority-bloc voting.  Ante, at 11.  The plurality finds \u201c[i]t \u2026 difficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met in a district where, by definition, white voters join in sufficient numbers with minority voters to elect the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not difficult to see.  If a minority population with 49% of the CVAP can elect the candidate of its choice with crossover by 2% of white voters, the minority \u201cby definition\u201d relies on white support to elect its preferred candidate.  But this fact alone would raise no doubt, as a matter of definition or otherwise, that the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met, since as much as 98% of the majority may have voted against the minority\u2019s candidate of choice.  As explained above, supra, at 8, the third Gingles condition may well impose an analytical floor to the minority population and a ceiling on the degree of crossover allowed in a crossover district; that is, the concept of majority-bloc voting requires that majority voters tend to stick together in a relatively high degree.  The precise standard for determining majority-bloc voting is not at issue in this case, however; to refute the plurality\u2019s 50% rule, one need only recognize that racial cohesion of 98% would be bloc voting by any standard.[Footnote 3]\n4\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality argues that qualifying crossover districts as minority-opportunity districts would be less administrable than demanding 50%, forcing courts to engage with the various factual and predictive questions that would come up in determining what percentage of majority voters would provide the voting minority with a chance at electoral success.  Ante, at 12\u201313.  But claims based on a State\u2019s failure to draw majority-minority districts raise the same issues of judicial judgment; even when the 50% threshold is satisfied, a court will still have to engage in factually messy enquiries about the \u201cpotential\u201d such a district may afford, the degree of minority cohesion and majority-bloc voting, and the existence of vote-dilution under a totality of the circumstances.  See supra, at 5\u20136, 8.  The plurality\u2019s rule, therefore, conserves an uncertain amount of judicial resources, and only at the expense of ignoring a class of \u00a72 claims that this Court has no authority to strike from the statute\u2019s coverage.\n5\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plurality again misunderstands the nature of \u00a72 in suggesting that its rule does not conflict with what the Court said in Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 480\u2013482 (2003): that crossover districts count as minority-opportunity districts for the purpose of assessing whether minorities have the opportunity \u201cto elect their preferred candidates of choice\u201d under \u00a75 of the VRA, 42 U. S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. \u00a71973c(b) (Supp. 2008).  While the plurality is, of course, correct that there are differences between the enquiries under \u00a72 and \u00a75, ante, at 20, those differences do not save today\u2019s decision from inconsistency with the prior pronouncement.  A districting plan violates \u00a75 if it diminishes the ability of minority voters to \u201celect their preferred candidates of choice,\u201d \u00a71973c(b), as measured against the minority\u2019s previous electoral opportunity, Ashcroft, supra, at 477.  A districting plan violates \u00a72 if it diminishes the ability of minority voters to \u201celect representatives of their choice,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.), as measured under a totality of the circumstances against a baseline of rough proportionality.  It makes no sense to say that a crossover district counts as a minority-opportunity district when comparing the past and the present under \u00a75, but not when comparing the present and the possible under \u00a72.\n6\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the plurality tries to support its insistence on a 50% threshold by invoking the policy of constitutional avoidance, which calls for construing a statute so as to avoid a possibly unconstitutional result.  The plurality suggests that allowing a lower threshold would \u201crequire crossover districts throughout the Nation,\u201d ante, at 17, thereby implicating the principle of Shaw v. Reno that districting with an excessive reliance on race is unconstitutional (\u201cexcessive\u201d now being equated by the plurality with the frequency of creating opportunity districts).  But the plurality has it precisely backwards.  A State will inevitably draw some crossover districts as the natural byproduct of districting based on traditional factors.  If these crossover districts count as minority-opportunity districts, the State will be much closer to meeting its \u00a72 obligation without any reference to race, and fewer minority-opportunity districts will, therefore, need to be created purposefully.  But if, as a matter of law, only majority-minority districts provide a minority seeking equality with the opportunity to elect its preferred candidates, the State will have much further to go to create a sufficient number of minority-opportunity districts, will be required to bridge this gap by creating exclusively majority-minority districts, and will inevitably produce a districting plan that reflects a greater focus on race.  The plurality, however, seems to believe that any reference to race in districting poses a constitutional concern, even a State\u2019s decision to reduce racial blocs in favor of crossover districts.  A judicial position with these consequences is not constitutional avoidance.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More serious than the plurality opinion\u2019s inconsistency with prior cases construing \u00a72 is the perversity of the results it portends.  Consider the effect of the plurality\u2019s rule on North Carolina\u2019s districting scheme.  Black voters make up approximately 20% of North Carolina\u2019s VAP[Footnote 4] and are distributed throughout 120 State House districts, App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a.  As noted before, black voters constitute more than 50% of the VAP in 9 of these districts and over 39% of the VAP in an additional 12.  Supra, at 7\u20138.  Under a functional approach to \u00a72, black voters in North Carolina have an opportunity to elect (and regularly do elect) the representative of their choice in as many as 21 House districts, or 17.5% of North Carolina\u2019s total districts.  See App. 109\u2013110.  North Carolina\u2019s districting plan is therefore close to providing black voters with proportionate electoral opportunity.  According to the plurality, however, the remedy of a crossover district cannot provide opportunity to minority voters who lack it, and the requisite opportunity must therefore be lacking for minority voters already living in districts where they must rely on crossover.  By the plurality\u2019s reckoning, then, black voters have an opportunity to elect representatives of their choice in, at most, nine North Carolina House districts.  See ibid.  In the plurality\u2019s view, North Carolina must have a long way to go before it satisfies the \u00a72 requirement of equal electoral opportunity.[Footnote 5]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A State like North Carolina faced with the plurality\u2019s opinion, whether it wants to comply with \u00a72 or simply to avoid litigation, will, therefore, have no reason to create crossover districts.  Section 2 recognizes no need for such districts, from which it follows that they can neither be required nor be created to help the State meet its obligation of equal electoral opportunity under \u00a72.  And if a legislature were induced to draw a crossover district by the plurality\u2019s encouragement to create them voluntarily, ante, at 20\u201321, it would open itself to attack by the plurality based on the pointed suggestion that a policy favoring crossover districts runs counter to Shaw.  The plurality has thus boiled \u00a72 down to one option: the best way to avoid suit under \u00a72, and the only way to comply with \u00a72, is by drawing district lines in a way that packs minority voters into majority-minority districts, probably eradicating crossover districts in the process.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the plurality recognizes this aberrant implication, for it eventually attempts to disavow it.  It asserts that \u201c\u00a72 allows States to choose their own method of complying with the Voting Rights Act, and we have said that may include drawing crossover districts. . . . [But] \u00a72 does not mandate creating or preserving crossover districts.\u201d  Ante, at 19.  See also, ante, at 20 (crossover districts \u201ccan be evidence \u2026 of equal political opportunity \u2026\u201d).  But this is judicial fiat, not legal reasoning; the plurality does not even attempt to explain how a crossover district can be a minority-opportunity district when assessing the compliance of a districting plan with \u00a72, but cannot be one when sought as a remedy to a \u00a72 violation.  The plurality cannot have it both ways.  If voluntarily drawing a crossover district brings a State into compliance with \u00a72, then requiring creation of a crossover district must be a way to remedy a violation of \u00a72, and eliminating a crossover district must in some cases take a State out of compliance with the statute.  And when the elimination of a crossover district does cause a violation of \u00a72, I cannot fathom why a voter in that district should not be able to bring a claim to remedy it.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, to the extent the plurality\u2019s holding is taken to control future results, the plurality has eliminated the protection of \u00a72 for the districts that best vindicate the goals of the statute, and has done all it can to force the States to perpetuate racially concentrated districts, the quintessential manifestations of race consciousness in American politics.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\u00a0We have previously illustrated this in stylized fashion:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAssume a hypothetical jurisdiction of 1,000 voters divided into 10 districts of 100 each, where members of a minority group make up 40 percent of the voting population and voting is totally polarized along racial lines.  With the right geographic dispersion to satisfy the compactness requirement, and with careful manipulation of district lines, the minority voters might be placed in control of as many as 7 of the 10 districts.  Each such district could be drawn with at least 51 members of the minority group, and whether the remaining minority voters were added to the groupings of 51 for safety or scattered in the other three districts, minority voters would be able to elect candidates of their choice in all seven districts.\u201d  Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1016 (1994).\n\u00a0Of course, this does not create an entitlement to proportionate minority representation.  Nothing in the statute promises electoral success.  Rather, \u00a72 simply provides that, subject to qualifications based on a totality of circumstances, minority voters are entitled to a practical chance to compete in a roughly proportionate number of districts.  Id., at 1014, n.\u00a011.  \u201c[M]inority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground.\u201d  Id., at 1020.\n\u00a0This case is an entirely inappropriate vehicle for speculation about a more exact definition of majority-bloc voting.  See supra, at 8\u20139.  The political science literature has developed statistical methods for assessing the extent of majority-bloc voting that are far more nuanced than the plurality\u2019s 50% rule.  See, e.g., Pildes 1534\u20131535 (describing a \u201cfalloff rate\u201d that social scientists use to measure the comparative rate at which whites vote for black Democratic candidates compared to white Democratic candidates and noting that the falloff rate for congressional elections during the 1990s in North Carolina was 9%).  But this issue was never briefed in this case and is not before us, the respondents having stipulated to the existence of majority-bloc voting, App. to Pet. for  Cert. 130a, and there is no reason to attempt to accomplish in this case through the first Gingles factor what would actually be a quantification of the third.\n\u00a0Compare Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 2000 Voting Age Population and Voting-Age Citizens (PHC\u2013T\u201331) (Table 1\u20131), online at http:/\u00a0/www.census.gov/population/www\u00a0/cen2000/briefs/phc-t31/index.html (as visited March 5, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (total VAP in North Carolina is 6,087,996), with id., Table 1\u20133 (black or African-American VAP is 1,216,622).\n\u00a0Under the same logic, North Carolina could fracture and submerge in majority-dominated districts the 12 districts in which black voters constitute between 35% and 49% of the voting population and routinely elect the candidates of their choice without ever implicating \u00a72, and could do so in districts not covered by \u00a75 without implicating the VRA at all.  The untenable implications of the plurality\u2019s rule do not end there.  The plurality declares that its holding \u201cdoes not apply to cases in which there is intentional discrimination against a racial minority.\u201d  Ante, at 15.  But the logic of the plurality\u2019s position compels the absurd conclusion that the invidious and intentional fracturing of crossover districts in order to harm minority voters would not state a claim under \u00a72.  After all, if the elimination of a crossover district can never deprive minority voters in the district of the opportunity \u201cto elect representatives of their choice,\u201d minorities in an invidiously eliminated district simply cannot show an injury under \u00a72."}, {"id": 1755, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962938, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/1/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1755", "justia_text": "BARTLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et\u00a0al. v. STRICKLAND et\u00a0al.\ncertiorari to the supreme court of north carolina\nNo. 07\u2013689.\u2003Argued October 14, 2008\u2014Decided March 9, 2009\nDespite the North Carolina Constitution\u2019s \u201cWhole County Provision\u201d prohibiting the General Assembly from dividing counties when drawing its own legislative districts, in 1991 the legislature drew House District 18 to include portions of four counties, including Pender County, for the asserted purpose of satisfying \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  At that time, District 18 was a geographically compact majority-minority district.  By the time the district was to be redrawn in 2003, the African-American voting-age population in District 18 had fallen below 50 percent.  Rather than redrawing the district to keep Pender County whole, the legislators split portions of it and another county.  District 18\u2019s African-American voting-age population is now 39.36 percent.  Keeping Pender County whole would have resulted in an African-American voting-age population of 35.33 percent.  The legislators\u2019 rationale was that splitting Pender County gave African-American voters the potential to join with majority voters to elect the minority group\u2019s candidate of choice, while leaving Pender County whole would have violated \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pender County and others filed suit, alleging that the redistricting plan violated the Whole County Provision.  The state-official defendants answered that dividing Pender County was required by \u00a72.  The trial court first considered whether the defendants had established the three threshold requirements for \u00a72 liability under Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 51, only the first of which is relevant here: whether the minority group \u201cis sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.\u201d  The court concluded that although African-Americans were not a majority of District 18\u2019s voting-age population, the district was a \u201cde facto\u201d majority-minority district because African-Americans could get enough support from crossover majority voters to elect their preferred candidate.  The court ultimately determined, based on the totality of the circumstances, that \u00a72 required that Pender County be split, and it sustained District 18\u2019s lines on that rationale.  The State Supreme Court reversed, holding that a minority group must constitute a numerical majority of the voting-age population in an area before \u00a72 requires the creation of a legislative district to prevent dilution of that group\u2019s votes.  Because African-Americans did not have such a numerical majority in District 18, the court ordered the legislature to redraw the district.    \nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is affirmed.\n361 N.\u00a0C. 491, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d 364, affirmed. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded that \u00a72 does not require state officials to draw election-district lines to allow a racial minority that would make up less than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the redrawn district to join with crossover voters to elect the minority\u2019s candidate of choice.  Pp.\u00a05\u201321.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0As amended in 1982, \u00a72 provides that a violation \u201cis established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the [election] processes \u2026 in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected] class [who] have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b).  Construing the amended \u00a72 in Gingles, supra, at 50\u201351, the Court identified three \u201cnecessary preconditions\u201d for a claim that the use of multimember districts constituted actionable vote dilution.  It later held that those requirements apply equally in \u00a72 cases involving single-member districts.  Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40\u201341.  Only when a party has established the requirements does a court proceed to analyze whether a \u00a72 violation has occurred based on the totality of the circumstances.  See, e.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1013.  Pp.\u00a05\u20137.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Only when a geographically compact group of minority voters could form a majority in a single-member district has the first Gingles requirement been met.  Pp.\u00a07\u201321.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0A party asserting \u00a72 liability must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the minority population in the potential election district is greater than 50 percent.  The Court has held both that \u00a72 can require the creation of a \u201cmajority-minority\u201d district, in which a minority group composes a numerical, working majority of the voting-age population, see, e.g., Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 154\u2013155, and that \u00a72 does not require the creation of an \u201cinfluence\u201d district, in which a minority group can influence the outcome of an election even if its preferred candidate cannot be elected, see League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, ___ (LULAC).  This case involves an intermediate, \u201ccrossover\u201d district, in which the minority makes up less than a majority of the voting-age population, but is large enough to elect the candidate of its choice with help from majority voters who cross over to support the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.  Petitioners\u2019 theory that such districts satisfy the first Gingles requirement is contrary to \u00a72, which requires a showing that minorities \u201chave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \u2026 elect representatives of their choice,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b).  Because they form only 39 percent of District 18\u2019s voting-age population, African-Americans standing alone have no better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than any other group with the same relative voting strength.  Recognizing a \u00a72 claim where minority voters cannot elect their candidate of choice based on their own votes and without assistance from others would grant special protection to their right to form political coalitions that is not authorized by the section.  Nor does the reasoning of this Court\u2019s cases support petitioners\u2019 claims.  In Voinovich, for example, the Court stated that the first Gingles requirement \u201cwould have to be modified or eliminated\u201d to allow crossover-district claims.  507 U. S., at 158.  Indeed, mandatory recognition of such claims would create serious tension with the third Gingles requirement, that the majority votes as a bloc to defeat minority-preferred candidates, see 478 U. S., at 50\u201351, and would call into question the entire Gingles framework.  On the other hand, the Court finds support for the clear line drawn by the majority-minority requirement in the need for workable standards and sound judicial and legislative administration.  By contrast, if \u00a72 required crossover districts, determining whether a \u00a72 claim would lie would require courts to make complex political predictions and tie them to race-based assumptions.  Heightening these concerns is the fact that because \u00a72 applies nationwide to every jurisdiction required to draw election-district lines under state or local law, crossover-district claims would require courts to make predictive political judgments not only about familiar, two-party contests in large districts but also about regional and local elections.  Unlike any of the standards proposed to allow crossover claims, the majority-minority rule relies on an objective, numerical test: Do minorities make up more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the relevant geographic area?  Given \u00a72\u2019s text, the Court\u2019s cases interpreting that provision, and the many difficulties in assessing \u00a72 claims without the restraint and guidance provided by the majority-minority rule, all of the federal courts of appeals that have interpreted the first Gingles factor have required a majority-minority standard.  The Court declines to depart from that uniform interpretation, which has stood for more than 20 years.  Because this case does not involve allegations of intentional and wrongful conduct, the Court need not consider whether intentional discrimination affects the Gingles analysis.  Pp.\u00a07\u201315.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Arguing for a less restrictive interpretation, petitioners point to \u00a72\u2019s guarantee that political processes be \u201cequally open to participation\u201d to protect minority voters\u2019 \u201copportunity \u2026 to elect representatives of their choice,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b), and assert that such \u201copportunit[ies]\u201d occur in crossover districts and require protection.  But petitioners emphasize the word \u201copportunity\u201d at the expense of the word \u201cequally.\u201d  The statute does not protect any possible opportunity through which minority voters could work with other constituencies to elect their candidate of choice.  Section 2 does not guarantee minority voters an electoral advantage.  Minority groups in crossover districts have the same opportunity to elect their candidate as any other political group with the same relative voting strength.  The majority-minority rule, furthermore, is not at odds with \u00a72\u2019s totality-of-the-circumstances test.  See, e.g., Growe, supra, at 40.  Any doubt as to whether \u00a72 calls for this rule is resolved by applying the canon of constitutional avoidance to steer clear of serious constitutional concerns under the Equal Protection Clause.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381\u2013382.  Such concerns would be raised if \u00a72 were interpreted to require crossover districts throughout the Nation, thereby \u201cunnecessarily infus[ing] race into virtually every redistricting.\u201d  LULAC, supra, at 446.  Pp.\u00a016\u201318. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This holding does not consider the permissibility of crossover districts as a matter of legislative choice or discretion.  Section 2 allows States to choose their own method of complying with the Voting Rights Act, which may include drawing crossover districts.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 480\u2013482.  Moreover, the holding should not be interpreted to entrench majority-minority districts by statutory command, for that, too, could pose constitutional concerns.  See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900.  Such districts are only required if all three Gingles factors are met and if \u00a72 applies based on the totality of the circumstances.  A claim similar to petitioners\u2019 assertion that the majority-minority rule is inconsistent with \u00a75 was rejected in LULAC, supra, at ___.

The Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, framework for analyzing such claims has no basis in \u00a72\u2019s text and \u201chas produced \u2026 a disastrous misadventure in judicial policymaking,\u201d Holder, supra, at 893.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973 (2000 ed.).  The question is whether the statute can be invoked to require state officials to draw election-district lines to allow a racial minority to join with other voters to elect the minority\u2019s candidate of choice, even where the racial minority is less than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the district to be drawn.  To use election-law terminology: In a district that is not a majority-minority district, if a racial minority could elect its candidate of choice with support from crossover majority voters, can \u00a72 require the district to be drawn to accommodate this potential?\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case arises in a somewhat unusual posture.  State authorities who created a district now invoke the Voting Rights Act as a defense.  They argue that \u00a72 required them to draw the district in question in a particular way, despite state laws to the contrary.  The state laws are provisions of the North Carolina Constitution that prohibit the General Assembly from dividing counties when drawing legislative districts for the State House and Senate.  Art. II, \u00a7\u00a73, 5.  We will adopt the term used by the state courts and refer to both sections of the state constitution as the Whole County Provision.  See Pender County v. Bartlett, 361 N.\u00a0C. 491, 493, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d 364, 366 (2007) (case below).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is common ground that state election-law requirements like the Whole County Provision may be superseded by federal law\u2014for instance, the one-person, one-vote principle of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.  See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964).  Here the question is whether \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act requires district lines to be drawn that otherwise would violate the Whole County Provision.  That, in turn, depends on how the statute is interpreted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the election district.  The North Carolina House of Representatives is the larger of the two chambers in the State\u2019s General Assembly.  District 18 of that body lies in the southeastern part of North Carolina.  Starting in 1991, the General Assembly drew District 18 to include portions of four counties, including Pender County, in order to create a district with a majority African-American voting-age population and to satisfy the Voting Rights Act.  Following the 2000 census, the North Carolina Supreme Court, to comply with the Whole County Provision, rejected the General Assembly\u2019s first two statewide redistricting plans.  See Stephenson v. Bartlett, 355 N.\u00a0C. 354, 375, 562 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 377, 392, stay denied, 535 U. S. 1301 (2002) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., in chambers); Stephenson v. Bartlett, 357 N.\u00a0C. 301, 314, 582 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 247, 254 (2003).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0District 18 in its present form emerged from the General Assembly\u2019s third redistricting attempt, in 2003.  By that time the African-American voting-age population had fallen below 50 percent in the district as then drawn, and the General Assembly no longer could draw a geographically compact majority-minority district.  Rather than draw District 18 to keep Pender County whole, however, the General Assembly drew it by splitting portions of Pender and New Hanover counties.  District 18 has an African-American voting-age population of 39.36 percent.  App. 139.  Had it left Pender County whole, the General Assembly could have drawn District 18 with an African-American voting-age population of 35.33 percent.  Id., at 73.  The General Assembly\u2019s reason for splitting Pender County was to give African-American voters the potential to join with majority voters to elect the minority group\u2019s candidate of its choice.  Ibid.  Failure to do so, state officials now submit, would have diluted the minority group\u2019s voting strength in violation of \u00a72.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In May 2004, Pender County and the five members of its Board of Commissioners filed the instant suit in North Carolina state court against the Governor of North Carolina, the Director of the State Board of Elections, and other state officials.  The plaintiffs alleged that the 2003 plan violated the Whole County Provision by splitting Pender County into two House districts.  App. 5\u201314.  The state-official defendants answered that dividing Pender County was required by \u00a72.  Id., at 25.  As the trial court recognized, the procedural posture of this case differs from most \u00a72 cases.  Here the defendants raise \u00a72 as a defense.  As a result, the trial court stated, they are \u201cin the unusual position\u201d of bearing the burden of proving that a \u00a72 violation would have occurred absent splitting Pender County to draw District 18.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 90a.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court first considered whether the defendant state officials had established the three threshold requirements for \u00a72 liability under Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50\u201351 (1986)\u2014namely, (1) that the minority group \u201cis sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,\u201d (2) that the minority group is \u201cpolitically cohesive,\u201d and (3) \u201cthat the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it \u2026 usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the first Gingles requirement, the trial court concluded that, although African-Americans were not a majority of the voting-age population in District 18, the district was a \u201cde facto\u201d majority-minority district because African-Americans could get enough support from crossover majority voters to elect the African-Americans\u2019 preferred candidate.  The court ruled that African-Americans in District 18 were politically cohesive, thus satisfying the second requirement.  And later, the plaintiffs stipulated that the third Gingles requirement was met.  App. to Pet. for Cert. at 102a\u2013103a, 130a.  The court then determined, based on the totality of the circumstances, that \u00a72 required the General Assembly to split Pender County.  The court sustained the lines for District 18 on that rationale.  Id., at 116a\u2013118a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three of the Pender County Commissioners appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendants had established the first Gingles requirement.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed.  It held that a \u201cminority group must constitute a numerical majority of the voting population in the area under consideration before Section 2 \u2026 requires the creation of a legislative district to prevent dilution of the votes of that minority group.\u201d  361 N.\u00a0C., at 502, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 371.  On that premise the State Supreme Court determined District 18 was not mandated by \u00a72 because African-Americans do not \u201cconstitute a numerical majority of citizens of voting age.\u201d  Id., at 507, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 374.  It ordered the General Assembly to redraw District 18.  Id., at 510, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 376.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now affirm.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was an important step in the struggle to end discriminatory treatment of minorities who seek to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of our citizens: the right to vote.  Though the Act as a whole was the subject of debate and controversy, \u00a72 prompted little criticism.  The likely explanation for its general acceptance is that, as first enacted, \u00a72 tracked, in part, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment.  It prohibited practices \u201cimposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d  79 Stat. 437; cf. U. S. Const., Amdt. 15 (\u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\u201d); see also S.\u00a0Rep. No. 162, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 19\u201320 (1965).  In Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 60\u201361 (1980), this Court held that \u00a72, as it then read, \u201cno more than elaborates upon \u2026 the Fifteenth Amendment\u201d and was \u201cintended to have an effect no different from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1982, after the Mobile ruling, Congress amended \u00a72, giving the statute its current form.  The original Act had employed an intent requirement, prohibiting only those practices \u201cimposed or applied \u2026 to deny or abridge\u201d the right to vote.  79 Stat. 437.  The amended version of \u00a72 requires consideration of effects, as it prohibits practices \u201cimposed or applied \u2026 in a manner which results in a denial or abridgment\u201d of the right to vote.  96 Stat. 134, 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(a) (2000 ed.).  The 1982 amendments also added a subsection, \u00a72(b), providing a test for determining whether a \u00a72 violation has occurred.  The relevant text of the statute now states:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(a)\u2002No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color [or membership in a language minority group], as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(b)\u2002A violation of subsection (a) of this section is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court first construed the amended version of \u00a72 in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986).  In Gingles, the plaintiffs were African-American residents of North Carolina who alleged that multimember districts diluted minority voting strength by submerging black voters into the white majority, denying them an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.  The Court identified three \u201cnecessary preconditions\u201d for a claim that the use of multimember districts constituted actionable vote dilution under \u00a72: (1) The minority group must be \u201csufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district,\u201d (2) the minority group must be \u201cpolitically cohesive,\u201d and (3) the majority must vote \u201csufficiently as a bloc to enable it \u2026 usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.\u201d  Id., at 50\u201351.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court later held that the three Gingles requirements apply equally in \u00a72 cases involving single-member districts, such as a claim alleging vote dilution because a geographically compact minority group has been split between two or more single-member districts.  Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40\u201341 (1993).  In a \u00a72 case, only when a party has established the Gingles requirements does a court proceed to analyze whether a violation has occurred based on the totality of the circumstances.  Gingles, supra, at 79; see also Johnson v. De\u00a0Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1013 (1994).\nIII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case turns on whether the first Gingles requirement can be satisfied when the minority group makes up less than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the potential election district.  The parties agree on all other parts of the Gingles analysis, so the dispositive question is: What size minority group is sufficient to satisfy the first Gingles requirement?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset the answer might not appear difficult to reach, for the Gingles Court said the minority group must \u201cdemonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.\u201d  478 U. S., at 50.  This would seem to end the matter, as it indicates the minority group must demonstrate it can constitute \u201ca majority.\u201d  But in Gingles and again in Growe the Court reserved what it considered to be a separate question\u2014whether, \u201cwhen a plaintiff alleges that a voting practice or procedure impairs a minority\u2019s ability to influence, rather than alter, election results, a showing of geographical compactness of a minority group not sufficiently large to constitute a majority will suffice.\u201d  Growe, supra, at 41, n.\u00a05; see also Gingles, supra, at 46\u201347, n.\u00a012.  The Court has since applied the Gingles requirements in \u00a72 cases but has declined to decide the minimum size minority group necessary to satisfy the first requirement.  See Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 154 (1993); De\u00a0Grandy, supra, at 1009; League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 443 (2006) (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (LULAC).  We must consider the minimum-size question in this case.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is appropriate to review the terminology often used to describe various features of election districts in relation to the requirements of the Voting Rights Act.  In majority-minority districts, a minority group composes a numerical, working majority of the voting-age population.  Under present doctrine, \u00a72 can require the creation of these districts.  See, e.g., Voinovich, supra, at 154 (\u201cPlacing black voters in a district in which they constitute a sizeable and therefore \u2018safe\u2019 majority ensures that they are able to elect their candidate of choice\u201d); but see Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 922\u2013923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  At the other end of the spectrum are influence districts, in which a minority group can influence the outcome of an election even if its preferred candidate cannot be elected.  This Court has held that \u00a72 does not require the creation of influence districts.  LULAC, supra, at 445 (opinion of Kennedy,\u00a0J.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present case involves an intermediate type of district\u2014a so-called crossover district.  Like an influence district, a crossover district is one in which minority voters make up less than a majority of the voting-age population.  But in a crossover district, the minority population, at least potentially, is large enough to elect the candidate of its choice with help from voters who are members of the majority and who cross over to support the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.  361 N.\u00a0C., at 501\u2013502, 649 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 371 (case below). This Court has referred sometimes to crossover districts as \u201ccoalitional\u201d districts, in recognition of the necessary coalition between minority and crossover majority voters.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 483 (2003); see also Pildes, Is Voting Rights Law Now at War with Itself? Social Science and Voting Rights in the 2000s, 80 N.\u00a0C. L.\u00a0Rev. 1517, 1539 (2002) (hereinafter Pildes).  But that term risks confusion with coalition-district claims in which two minority groups form a coalition to elect the candidate of the coalition\u2019s choice.  See, e.g., Nixon v. Kent County, 76 F.\u00a03d 1381, 1393 (CA6 1996) (en banc).  We do not address that type of coalition district here.  The petitioners in the present case (the state officials who were the defendants in the trial court) argue that \u00a72 requires a crossover district, in which minority voters might be able to persuade some members of the majority to cross over and join with them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners argue that although crossover districts do not include a numerical majority of minority voters, they still satisfy the first Gingles requirement because they are \u201ceffective minority districts.\u201d  Under petitioners\u2019 theory keeping Pender County whole would have violated \u00a72 by cracking the potential crossover district that they drew as District 18.  See Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46, n.\u00a011 (vote dilution \u201cmay be caused by the dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters\u201d).  So, petitioners contend, \u00a72 required them to override state law and split Pender County, drawing District 18 with an African-American voting-age population of 39.36 percent rather than keeping Pender County whole and leaving District 18 with an African-American voting-age population of 35.33 percent.  We reject that claim.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, we conclude, the petitioners\u2019 theory is contrary to the mandate of \u00a72.  The statute requires a showing that minorities \u201chave less opportunity than other members of the electorate to \u2026 elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.).  But because they form only 39 percent of the voting-age population in District 18, African-Americans standing alone have no better or worse opportunity to elect a candidate than does any other group of voters with the same relative voting strength.  That is, African-Americans in District 18 have the opportunity to join other voters\u2014including other racial minorities, or whites, or both\u2014to reach a majority and elect their preferred candidate.  They cannot, however, elect that candidate based on their own votes and without assistance from others.  Recognizing a \u00a72 claim in this circumstance would grant minority voters \u201ca right to preserve their strength for the purposes of forging an advantageous political alliance.\u201d  Hall v. Virginia, 385 F.\u00a03d 421, 431 (CA4 2004); see also Voinovich, supra, at 154 (minorities in crossover districts \u201ccould not dictate electoral outcomes independently\u201d).  Nothing in \u00a72 grants special protection to a minority group\u2019s right to form political coalitions.  \u201c[M]inority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground.\u201d  De\u00a0Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1020.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court has reserved the question we confront today and has cautioned that the Gingles requirements \u201ccannot be applied mechanically,\u201d Voinovich, supra, at 158, the reasoning of our cases does not support petitioners\u2019 claims.  Section 2 does not impose on those who draw election districts a duty to give minority voters the most potential, or the best potential, to elect a candidate by attracting crossover voters.  In setting out the first requirement for \u00a72 claims, the Gingles Court explained that \u201c[u]nless minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot claim to have been injured by that structure or practice.\u201d  478 U. S., at 50, n.\u00a017.  The Growe Court stated that the first Gingles requirement is \u201cneeded to establish that the minority has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in some single-member district.\u201d  507 U. S., at 40.  Without such a showing, \u201cthere neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\u201d  Id., at 41.  There is a difference between a racial minority group\u2019s \u201cown choice\u201d and the choice made by a coalition.  In Voinovich, the Court stated that the first Gingles requirement \u201cwould have to be modified or eliminated\u201d to allow crossover-district claims.  507 U. S., at 158.  Only once, in dicta, has this Court framed the first Gingles requirement as anything other than a majority-minority rule.  See De\u00a0Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1008 (requiring \u201ca sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice\u201d).  And in the same case, the Court rejected the proposition, inherent in petitioners\u2019 claim here, that \u00a72 entitles minority groups to the maximum possible voting strength:\n\u201c[R]eading \u00a72 to define dilution as any failure to maximize tends to obscure the very object of the statute and to run counter to its textually stated purpose. One may suspect vote dilution from political famine, but one is not entitled to suspect (much less infer) dilution from mere failure to guarantee a political feast.\u201d  Id., at 1016\u20131017.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Allowing crossover-district claims would require us to revise and reformulate the Gingles threshold inquiry that has been the baseline of our \u00a72 jurisprudence.  Mandatory recognition of claims in which success for a minority depends upon crossover majority voters would create serious tension with the third Gingles requirement that the majority votes as a bloc to defeat minority-preferred candidates.  It is difficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met in a district where, by definition, white voters join in sufficient numbers with minority voters to elect the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.  (We are skeptical that the bloc-voting test could be satisfied here, for example, where minority voters in District 18 cannot elect their candidate of choice without support from almost 20 percent of white voters.  We do not confront that issue, however, because for some reason respondents conceded the third Gingles requirement in state court.)  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Gingles Court explained, \u201cin the absence of significant white bloc voting it cannot be said that the ability of minority voters to elect their chosen representatives is inferior to that of white voters.\u201d  478 U. S., at 49, n.\u00a015.  Were the Court to adopt petitioners\u2019 theory and dispense with the majority-minority requirement, the ruling would call in question the Gingles framework the Court has applied under \u00a72.  See LULAC, 548 U. S., at 490, n.\u00a08. (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAll aspects of our established analysis for majority-minority districts in Gingles and its progeny may have to be rethought in analyzing ostensible coalition districts\u201d); cf. Metts v. Murphy, 363 F.\u00a03d 8, 12 (CA1 2004) (en banc) (per curiam) (allowing influence-district claim to survive motion to dismiss but noting \u201cthere is tension in this case for plaintiffs in any effort to satisfy both the first and third prong of Gingles\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We find support for the majority-minority requirement in the need for workable standards and sound judicial and legislative administration.  The rule draws clear lines for courts and legislatures alike.  The same cannot be said of a less exacting standard that would mandate crossover districts under \u00a72.  Determining whether a \u00a72 claim would lie\u2014i.e., determining whether potential districts could function as crossover districts\u2014would place courts in the untenable position of predicting many political variables and tying them to race-based assumptions.  The judiciary would be directed to make predictions or adopt premises that even experienced polling analysts and political experts could not assess with certainty, particularly over the long term.  For example, courts would be required to pursue these inquiries:  What percentage of white voters supported minority-preferred candidates in the past?  How reliable would the crossover votes be in future elections?  What types of candidates have white and minority voters supported together in the past and will those trends continue?  Were past crossover votes based on incumbency and did that depend on race?  What are the historical turnout rates among white and minority voters and will they stay the same?  Those questions are speculative, and the answers (if they could be supposed) would prove elusive.  A requirement to draw election districts on answers to these and like inquiries ought not to be inferred from the text or purpose of \u00a72.  Though courts are capable of making refined and exacting factual inquiries, they \u201care inherently ill-equipped\u201d to \u201cmake decisions based on highly political judgments\u201d of the sort that crossover-district claims would require.  Holder, 512 U. S., at 894 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  There is an underlying principle of fundamental importance: We must be most cautious before interpreting a statute to require courts to make inquiries based on racial classifications and race-based predictions.  The statutory mandate petitioners urge us to find in \u00a72 raises serious constitutional questions.  See infra, at 16\u201318.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Heightening these concerns even further is the fact that \u00a72 applies nationwide to every jurisdiction that must draw lines for election districts required by state or local law.  Crossover-district claims would require courts to make predictive political judgments not only about familiar, two-party contests in large districts but also about regional and local jurisdictions that often feature more than two parties or candidates.  Under petitioners\u2019 view courts would face the difficult task of discerning crossover patterns in nonpartisan contests for a city commission, a school board, or a local water authority.  The political data necessary to make such determinations are nonexistent for elections in most of those jurisdictions.  And predictions would be speculative at best given that, especially in the context of local elections, voters\u2019 personal affiliations with candidates and views on particular issues can play a large role.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike any of the standards proposed to allow crossover-district claims, the majority-minority rule relies on an objective, numerical test: Do minorities make up more than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the relevant geographic area?  That rule provides straightforward guidance to courts and to those officials charged with drawing district lines to comply with \u00a72.  See LULAC, supra, at 485 (opinion of Souter, J.) (recognizing need for \u201cclear-edged rule\u201d).  Where an election district could be drawn in which minority voters form a majority but such a district is not drawn, or where a majority-minority district is cracked by assigning some voters elsewhere, then\u2014assuming the other Gingles factors are also satisfied\u2014denial of the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice is a present and discernible wrong that is not subject to the high degree of speculation and prediction attendant upon the analysis of crossover claims.  Not an arbitrary invention, the majority-minority rule has its foundation in principles of democratic governance.  The special significance, in the democratic process, of a majority means it is a special wrong when a minority group has 50 percent or more of the voting population and could constitute a compact voting majority but, despite racially polarized bloc voting, that group is not put into a district.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the text of \u00a72, our cases interpreting that provision, and the many difficulties in assessing \u00a72 claims without the restraint and guidance provided by the majority-minority rule, no federal court of appeals has held that \u00a72 requires creation of coalition districts.  Instead, all to consider the question have interpreted the first Gingles factor to require a majority-minority standard.  See Hall, 385 F.\u00a03d, at 427\u2013430 (CA4 2004), cert. denied, 544 U. S. 961 (2005); Valdespino v. Alamo Heights Independent School Dist., 168 F.\u00a03d 848, 852\u2013853 (CA5 1999), cert. denied, 528 U. S. 1114 (2000); Cousin v.

Springfield Park Dist., 851 F.\u00a02d 937, 947 (CA7 1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1031 (1989). Cf. Metts, 363 F.\u00a03d, at 11 (expressing unwillingness \u201cat the complaint stage to foreclose the possibility\u201d of influence-district claims).  We decline to depart from the uniform interpretation of \u00a72 that has guided federal courts and state and local officials for more than 20 years.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the Gingles requirements \u201ccannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim.\u201d Voinovich, 507 U. S., at 158.  It remains the rule, however, that a party asserting \u00a72 liability must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the minority population in the potential election district is greater than 50 percent.  No one contends that the African-American voting-age population in District 18 exceeds that threshold.  Nor does this case involve allegations of intentional and wrongful conduct.  We therefore need not consider whether intentional discrimination affects the Gingles analysis.  Cf. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14 (evidence of discriminatory intent \u201ctends to suggest that the jurisdiction is not providing an equal opportunity to minority voters to elect the representative of their choice, and it is therefore unnecessary to consider the majority-minority requirement before proceeding to the ultimate totality-of-the-circumstances analysis\u201d); see also Garza v. County of Los Angeles, 918 F.\u00a02d 763, 771 (CA9 1990).  Our holding does not apply to cases in which there is intentional discrimination against a racial minority.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In arguing for a less restrictive interpretation of the first Gingles requirement petitioners point to the text of \u00a72 and its guarantee that political processes be \u201cequally open to participation\u201d to protect minority voters\u2019 \u201copportunity \u2026 to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.).  An \u201copportunity,\u201d petitioners argue, occurs in crossover districts as well as majority-minority districts; and these extended opportunities, they say, require \u00a72 protection.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But petitioners put emphasis on the word \u201copportunity\u201d at the expense of the word \u201cequally.\u201d  The statute does not protect any possible opportunity or mechanism through which minority voters could work with other constituencies to elect their candidate of choice.  Section 2 does not guarantee minority voters an electoral advantage.  Minority groups in crossover districts cannot form a voting majority without crossover voters.  In those districts minority voters have the same opportunity to elect their candidate as any other political group with the same relative voting strength.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority-minority rule, furthermore, is not at odds with \u00a72\u2019s totality-of-the-circumstances test.  The Court in De\u00a0Grandy confirmed \u201cthe error of treating the three Gingles conditions as exhausting the enquiry required by \u00a72.\u201d  512 U. S., at 1013.  Instead the Gingles requirements are preconditions, consistent with the text and purpose of \u00a72, to help courts determine which claims could meet the totality-of-the-circumstances standard for a \u00a72 violation.  See Growe, 507 U. S., at 40 (describing the \u201cGingles threshold factors\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent there is any doubt whether \u00a72 calls for the majority-minority rule, we resolve that doubt by avoiding serious constitutional concerns under the Equal Protection Clause.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381\u2013382 (2005) (canon of constitutional avoidance is \u201ca tool for choosing between competing plausible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts\u201d).  Of course, the \u201cmoral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d and racial classifications are permitted only \u201cas a last resort.\u201d  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 518, 519 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  \u201cRacial classifications with respect to voting carry particular dangers.  Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions; it threatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters\u2014a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and to which the Nation continues to aspire.\u201d  Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 657 (1993).  If \u00a72 were interpreted to require crossover districts throughout the Nation, \u201cit would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.\u201d  LULAC, 548 U. S., at 446 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  That interpretation would result in a substantial increase in the number of mandatory districts drawn with race as \u201cthe predominant factor motivating the legislature\u2019s decision.\u201d  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916 (1995).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On petitioners\u2019 view of the case courts and legislatures would need to scrutinize every factor that enters into districting to gauge its effect on crossover voting.  Injecting this racial measure into the nationwide districting process would be of particular concern with respect to consideration of party registration or party influence.  The easiest and most likely alliance for a group of minority voters is one with a political party, and some have suggested using minority voters\u2019 strength within a particular party as the proper yardstick under the first Gingles requirement.  See, e.g., LULAC, supra, at 485\u2013486 (opinion of Souter, J.) (requiring only \u201cthat minority voters \u2026 constitute a majority of those voting in the primary of \u2026 the party tending to win in the general election\u201d).  That approach would replace an objective, administrable rule with a difficult \u201cjudicial inquiry into party rules and local politics\u201d to determine whether a minority group truly \u201ccontrols\u201d the dominant party\u2019s primary process.  McLoughlin, Gingles in Limbo: Coalitional Districts, Party Primaries and Manageable Vote Dilution Claims, 80 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0U. L.\u00a0Rev. 312, 349 (2005).  More troubling still is the inquiry\u2019s fusion of race and party affiliation as a determinant when partisan considerations themselves may be suspect in the drawing of district lines.  See Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 317 (2004) (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 316 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); see also Pildes 1565 (crossover-district requirement would essentially result in political party \u201centitlement to \u2026 a certain number of seats\u201d).  Disregarding the majority-minority rule and relying on a combination of race and party to presume an effective majority would involve the law and courts in a perilous enterprise.  It would rest on judicial predictions, as a matter of law, that race and party would hold together as an effective majority over time\u2014at least for the decennial apportionment cycles and likely beyond.  And thus would the relationship between race and party further distort and frustrate the search for neutral factors and principled rationales for districting.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners\u2019 approach would reverse the canon of avoidance.  It invites the divisive constitutional questions that are both unnecessary and contrary to the purposes of our precedents under the Voting Rights Act.  Given the consequences of extending racial considerations even further into the districting process, we must not interpret \u00a72 to require crossover districts.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our holding that \u00a72 does not require crossover districts does not consider the permissibility of such districts as a matter of legislative choice or discretion.  Assuming a majority-minority district with a substantial minority population, a legislative determination, based on proper factors, to create two crossover districts may serve to diminish the significance and influence of race by encouraging minority and majority voters to work together toward a common goal.  The option to draw such districts gives legislatures a choice that can lead to less racial isolation, not more.  And as the Court has noted in the context of \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act, \u201cvarious studies have suggested that the most effective way to maximize minority voting strength may be to create more influence or [crossover] districts.\u201d  Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 482.  Much like \u00a75, \u00a72 allows States to choose their own method of complying with the Voting Rights Act, and we have said that may include drawing crossover districts.  See id., at 480\u2013483.  When we address the mandate of \u00a72, however, we must note it is not concerned with maximizing minority voting strength, De\u00a0Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1022; and, as a statutory matter, \u00a72 does not mandate creating or preserving crossover districts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our holding also should not be interpreted to entrench majority-minority districts by statutory command, for that, too, could pose constitutional concerns.  See Miller v. Johnson, supra; Shaw v. Reno, supra.  States that wish to draw crossover districts are free to do so where no other prohibition exists.  Majority-minority districts are only required if all three Gingles factors are met and if \u00a72 applies based on a totality of the circumstances.  In areas with substantial crossover voting it is unlikely that the plaintiffs would be able to establish the third Gingles precondition\u2014bloc voting by majority voters.  See supra, at 11.  In those areas majority-minority districts would not be required in the first place; and in the exercise of lawful discretion States could draw crossover districts as they deemed appropriate.  See Pildes 1567 (\u201cDistricts could still be designed in such places that encouraged coalitions across racial lines, but these districts would result from legislative choice, not \u2026 obligation\u201d).  States can\u2014and in proper cases should\u2014defend against alleged \u00a72 violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to effective crossover districts.  Those can be evidence, for example, of diminished bloc voting under the third Gingles factor or of equal political opportunity under the \u00a72 totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.  And if there were a showing that a State intentionally drew district lines in order to destroy otherwise effective crossover districts, that would raise serious questions under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  See Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 481\u2013482 (1997); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13\u201314.  There is no evidence of discriminatory intent in this case, however.  Our holding recognizes only that there is no support for the claim that \u00a72\ncan require the creation of crossover districts in the first\ninstance.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners claim the majority-minority rule is inconsistent with \u00a75, but we rejected a similar argument in LULAC, 548 U. S., at 446 (opinion of Kennedy,\u00a0J.).  The inquiries under \u00a7\u00a72 and 5 are different.  Section 2 concerns minority groups\u2019 opportunity \u201cto elect representatives of their choice,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71973(b) (2000 ed.), while the more stringent \u00a75 asks whether a change has the purpose or effect of \u201cdenying or abridging the right to vote,\u201d \u00a71973c.  See LULAC, supra, at 446; Bossier Parish, supra, at 476\u2013480.  In LULAC, we held that although the presence of influence districts is relevant for the \u00a75 retrogression analysis, \u201cthe lack of such districts cannot establish a \u00a72 violation.\u201d  548 U. S., at 446 (opinion of Kennedy,\u00a0J.); see also Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 482\u2013483.  The same analysis applies for crossover districts: Section 5 \u201cleaves room\u201d for States to employ crossover districts, id., at 483, but \u00a72 does not require them.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some commentators suggest that racially polarized voting is waning\u2014as evidenced by, for example, the election of minority candidates where a majority of voters are white.  See Note, The Future of Majority-Minority Districts in Light of Declining Racially Polarized Voting, 116 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2208, 2209 (2003); see also id., at 2216\u20132222; Pildes 1529\u20131539; Bullock & Dunn, The Demise of Racial Districting and the Future of Black Representation, 48 Emory L.\u00a0J. 1209 (1999).  Still, racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not ancient history.  Much remains to be done to ensure that citizens of all races have equal opportunity to share and participate in our democratic processes and traditions; and \u00a72 must be interpreted to ensure that continued progress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be an irony, however, if \u00a72 were interpreted to entrench racial differences by expanding a \u201cstatute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics.\u201d  De\u00a0Grandy, supra, at 1020.  Crossover districts are, by definition, the result of white voters joining forces with minority voters to elect their preferred candidate.  The Voting Rights Act was passed to foster this cooperation.  We decline now to expand the reaches of \u00a72 to require, by force of law, the voluntary cooperation our society has achieved.  Only when a geographically compact group of minority voters could form a majority in a single-member district has the first Gingles requirement been met.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/1/"}, {"ID": 55555, "name": "Horne v.

In January 2000, the court had cited the state for civil contempt for failing to adequately fund English Language Learner programs, in violation of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act and subsequently rejected proposed legislation as inadequate to resolve the programs' deficiencies. The superintendent and representatives argued that increases in state funding, changes in the management of the school district involved, and passage of the No Child Left Behind Act sufficiently altered the foundations of the district court's original ruling and therefore relief was warranted. The federal district court of Arizona denied the motion.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that since Arizona never appealed or complied with the district court's original order that it was fair to require compliance.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did the lower courts err in their analysis under Rule 60(b)(5) regarding Arizona's contention that changes in education law, including increased state funding, changes in the management of the school district involved, and passage of the No Child Left Behind Act had so altered the foundations of prior court rulings that relief from such judgments was warranted?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that the lower courts erred in their analysis under Rule 60(b)(5). With Justice Samuel A. Alito writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, the Court criticized the lower courts for implementing a Rule 60(b)(5) standard that was too strict. It remanded the case for the federal district court to examine four factual and legal areas that may warrant relief for Arizona from its court orders: 1) the impact of a new ELL learning program, 2) the impact of No Child Left Behind, 3) the impact of structural and managerial changes in its school system, and 4) the impact of an increased state general education fund.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer dissented and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He disagreed with the Court's reasoning, arguing that the lower courts fairly considered every change in the circumstances that Arizona called to the courts' attention.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 33983, "name": "Kenneth W.

Mr. Ventris was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated battery by the District Court of Montgomery County in Kansas. To rebut the testimony of Mr. Ventris at trial, the State relied on the testimony of his former cell mate, Johnnie Doser. The government recruited Mr. Doser to keep his \"ear open\" and listen for incriminating statements made by Mr. Ventris. Mr. Ventris appealed claiming this testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court's decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals but reversed by the Supreme Court of Kansas.</p>\n<p>The court held that \"[w]ithout a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel, the admission of the defendant's uncounseled statements to an undercover informant who is secretly acting as a State agent violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.\" It reasoned that the fact finding responsibilities of the trial court do not outweigh individuals' constitutional rights.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Are statements obtained in the absence of a knowing and voluntary waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel admissible for the purposes of impeaching a defendant's testimony?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. Mr. Ventris' statements, elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, were admissible to impeach his inconsistent testimony at trial. With Justice Antonin G. Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that the interests protected by excluding \"tainted evidence\" are outweighed by the need to assure \"integrity of the trial process.\"</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented. He sharply criticized the majority for allowing the State to cut corners in criminal proceedings at the expense of criminal defendants' constitutional guarantees.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 41786, "name": "Stephen R.

UNITED STATES\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\nNo. 07\u201310689.\u2003Decided October 14, 2008\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0James Eric Moore was convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, a violation of 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1).  Given the quantity of crack cocaine, the presentence report calculated that Moore\u2019s sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 151 to 188 months.  At sentencing, Moore asked the District Court to impose a below-Guidelines sentence in light of our decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treatment of similar amounts of crack and powder cocaine.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court refused, saying:\n\u201cWith regard to the crack and powder cocaine difference, that is the law.  I\u2019m applying the law as it currently stands.  If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional matter.  Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put in\u2014in force\u2026\u00a0. It isn\u2019t the judges.  It\u2019s the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the law, and that\u2019s what I will do in this sentencing.\u201d  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 55\u201356.\n\nThe District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.  United States v. Moore, 470 F.\u00a03d 767 (2006).  In response to his claim that the District Court should have considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe district court was correct in concluding that \u2018neither Booker nor [18 U. S.\u00a0C.] \u00a73553(a) authorizes district courts to reject\u2019 the powder cocaine to crack cocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the Guidelines.\u201d  Id., at 770 (quoting United States v. Spears, 469 F.\u00a03d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).  Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.  Pet. for Cert. in Moore v. United States, No. 06\u20139749.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Moore\u2019s certiorari petition was pending, this Court issued its opinion in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge \u201cmay consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses\u201d when applying 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a), \u201ceven in a mine-run case.\u201d  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 21).  We granted Moore\u2019s petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of Kimbrough.  Moore v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit affirmed again.  518 F.\u00a03d 577 (2008).  This time, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[a]s there was then no circuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware that Booker granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.\u201d  Id., at 580.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proceeding pro se, Moore again petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s new characterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is \u201cclear that the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject\u201d the Guidelines ratio.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States agrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States 9, and so do we.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the District Court said that \u201c[i]t isn\u2019t the judges\u201d but Congress that \u201clooks at the [G]uidelines and decides whether or not they should be put \u2026 in force,\u201d the court showed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld by Kimbrough.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56.  The Eighth Circuit\u2019s first decision recognized this, describing the District Court as \u201cconcluding\u201d (correctly under circuit precedent) that it was not \u201cauthorize[d] . . . to reject\u201d the crack/powder disparity.  Moore, 470 F.\u00a03d, at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of the District Court\u2019s comments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing under Kimbrough.  We express no views on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/1/"}, {"ID": 55558, "name": "Chambers v.

After finding that Chambers had committed three previous crimes of violence, the judge sentenced him to 188 months in prison. The judge based his sentencing decision on the Armed Career Criminals Act (ACCA) which defines a crime of violence as any crime posing a serious risk of potential injury to another and imposes a sentencing hike on a defendant with three such convictions on his record. On appeal, Chambers argued that one of the prior convictions, for felonious escape under Illinois law, should not qualify as a crime of violence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to grant Chambers relief. Finding that Chambers had \"knowingly fail[ed] to report to a penal institution\" on several occasions, the equivalent of an actual escape under Illinois law, the court affirmed his sentence. Although the court determined that its precedents compelled such a ruling, the opinion indicated that more research would be needed to determine the desirability of classifying all escapes and failures to report as crimes of violence. For the time being, however, the court perpetuated Illinois' rule that felonious escape of any kind qualifies as a crime of violence for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does a conviction for felonious escape under Illinois law, arising from the defendant's failure to report for imprisonment, qualify as a \"crime of violence\" for the purposes of the federal Armed Career Criminals Act?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. Justice Stephen G. Breyer writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice David H.

The Court reasoned that the \"failure to report\" crime does not \"involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\" as it is a crime of inaction and therefore should not be categorized as a \"crime of violence\".</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote a separate concurring opinion and was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. While agreeing with the Court's analysis, Justice Alito highlighted the difficulty the courts have had in applying the ACCA.

His employer, Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. sought declaratory judgment in a federal district court to determine its obligations toward him. Mr. Townsend counterclaimed. In part, he alleged arbitrary and willful failure to pay maintenance and cure for his injuries, and sought punitive damages. Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. motioned to dismiss the request for punitive damages. The district court denied the motion, but allowed for interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed. The court held it was bound by its prior decision in <em>Hines v. J.A. LaPorte, Inc</em>. There, it concluded a seaman may recover punitive damages when an employer arbitrarily and willfully refuses to pay maintenance and cure for his injuries. It reasoned that the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Miles v. Apex Marine Corp</em>. did not apply. In that case, the Court held that recovery for \"non-pecuniary loss in the wrongful death of a seaman was not available under general maritime law\". The court of appeals reasoned that Miles was not \"clearly on point\" to the facts in Mr. Townsend's case.</p>\n", "question": "<p>May a seaman seek punitive damages when his employer arbitrarily and willfully refuses to pay maintenance and cure for his injuries?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that punitive damages remain available for the willful and and wanton disregard of the maintenance and cure obligation. With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court reasoned that since punitive damages have long been accepted under general maritime law and neither <em>Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.</em> or the Jones Act altered this understanding, punitive damages remain available.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, and Anthony M. Kennedy. He argued that under <em>Miles</em> courts should be reluctant to award relief under general maritime law that is not available under a statutory claim. Thus, punitive damages should not be available to Mr. Townshend.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 21192, "name": "David W.

EDGAR L. TOWNSEND\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 25, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19 (1990), this Court provided a workable framework for analyzing the relief available on claims under general maritime law.  Today, the Court abruptly changes course.  I would apply the analytical framework adopted in Miles, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to understand our decision in Miles, it is necessary to appreciate the nature of the authority that the Miles Court was exercising.  The Constitution, by extending the judicial power of the United States to admiralty and maritime cases, impliedly empowered this Court to continue the development of maritime law \u201cin the manner of a common law court.\u201d  Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16); see also Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 360\u2013361 (1959).  In Miles, this Court explained how that authority should be exercised in an era in which statutory law has become dominant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miles presented two questions regarding the scope of relief permitted under general maritime law, the first of which was whether damages for loss of society may be recovered on a general maritime law wrongful-death claim.  In order to answer this question, the Court looked to the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730301\net seq., and the Jones Act 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730101 et seq., both of which created new statutory wrongful-death claims.  Because the relief available on these statutory claims does not include damages for loss of society, the Court concluded that it should not permit such damages on a wrongful-death claim brought under general maritime law.  The Court explained:\n\u201cWe no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress and the States have legislated extensively in these areas.  In this era, an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.\u201d  498 U. S., at 27 (emphasis added).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court took a similar approach in answering the second question in Miles\u2014whether damages for loss of future income should be available in a general maritime law survival action.  The Court noted that \u201c[t]here are indeed strong policy arguments for allowing such recovery\u201d and that \u201cadmiralty courts have always shown a special solicitude for the welfare of seamen and their families.\u201d  Id., at 35\u201336.  But because the Jones Act survival provision \u201climits recovery to losses suffered during the decedent\u2019s lifetime,\u201d the Court held that a similar limitation should apply under general maritime law.  Id., at 36.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miles thus instructs that, in exercising our authority to develop general maritime law, we should be guided primarily by the policy choices reflected in statutes creating closely related claims.  Endorsing what has been termed a principle of uniformity, Miles teaches that if a form of relief is not available on a statutory claim, we should be reluctant to permit such relief on a similar claim brought under general maritime law.\nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The type of maintenance and cure claim that is most likely to include a request for punitive damages is a claim that a seaman suffered personal injury as a result of the willful refusal to provide maintenance and cure.  Such a claim may be brought under general maritime law.  See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374 (1932) (recognizing that a seaman may sue under general maritime law to recover for personal injury resulting from the denial of maintenance and cure).  And a similar claim may also be maintained under the Jones Act.  See, e.g., Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d 1496, 1499\u20131500 (CA5 1995) (en banc); G. Gilmore & C. Black,  Law of Admiralty \u00a76\u201313, p. 311 (2d ed. 1975).  To be sure, a seaman asserting a Jones Act claim must show that his employer was negligent, ibid., while a seaman proceeding under general maritime law may recover compensatory damages without establishing fault, id., at 310.  But because the prevailing rule in American courts does not permit punitive damages without a showing of fault, see Exxon Shipping, supra, at 16, n.\u00a02, it appears that any personal injury maintenance and cure claim in which punitive damages might be awarded could be brought equally under either general maritime law or the Jones Act.  The Miles uniformity therefore weighs strongly in favor of a rule that applies uniformly under general maritime law and the Jones Act.  I therefore turn to the question whether punitive damages may be awarded under the Jones Act.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Enacted in 1920, the Jones Act, 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a730104\u201330105(b), makes applicable to seamen the substantive recovery provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a751 et seq., which became law in 1908.  FELA, in turn, \u201crecites only that employers shall be liable in \u2018damages\u2019 for the injury or death of one protected under the Act.\u201d  Miles, supra, at 32 (citing 45 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a751).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the enactment of the Jones Act, however, this Court had decided several cases that explored the damages allowed under FELA.  In Michigan Central R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59 (1913), the Court dealt primarily with the damages that may be recovered under FELA\u2019s wrongful-death provision, but the Court also discussed the damages available in the case of injury.  The Court noted that if the worker in that case had not died from his injuries, \u201che might have recovered such damages as would have compensated him for his expense, loss of time, suffering and diminished earning power.\u201d  Id., at 65.  Two years later, in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648 (1915), the Court reiterated that an injured worker may recover only compensatory damages.  Addressing the damages available to a party bringing a survival claim, the Court explained that the party may recover only those damages that had accrued to the worker at the time of his death and was thus limited to \u201csuch damages as will be reasonably compensatory for the loss and suffering of the injured person while he lived.\u201d  Id., at 658.  See also ibid. (damages \u201cconfined to the [the worker\u2019s] personal loss and suffering before he died\u201d); Miller v. American President Lines, Ltd., 989 F.\u00a02d 1450, 1457 (CA6), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 915 (1993) (\u201cIt has been the unanimous judgment of the courts since before the enactment of the Jones Act that punitive damages are not recoverable under [FELA]).\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Congress incorporated FELA unaltered into the Jones Act, Congress must have intended to incorporate FELA\u2019s limitation on damages as well.  Miles, 498 U. S., at 32.  \u201cWe assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.\u201d  Ibid. (citing Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696\u2013697 (1979)).  It is therefore reasonable to assume that only compensatory damages may be recovered under the Jones Act.  See Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 136\u2013.139 (1928) (under the Jones Act, a seaman may \u201crecover compensatory damages for injuries caused by the negligence\u201d).  And under Miles\u2019 reasoning\u2014at least in the absence of some exceptionally strong countervailing considerations\u2014the rule should be the same when a seaman sues under general maritime law for personal injury resulting from the denial of maintenance and cure.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court reasons that: punitive damages were available on maintenance and cure claims prior to the enactment of the Jones Act and that the Jones Act was not intended to trim the relief available on such general maritime law claims.  This reasoning is flawed.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court proceeds as if the question here were whether the Jones Act was meant to preclude general maritime law claims and remedies.  See ante, at 9\u201310 (Jones Act does not \u201covertur[n]\u201d or \u201celiminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen\u201d); ante, at 11 (Jones Act \u201cpreserves common-law causes of action\u201d); ante, at 15 (Miles does not \u201cpreclud[e]\u201d all claims and remedies beyond that made available under the Jones Act).  Miles explicitly rejected that argument.  See 498 U. S., at 29.  But just because the Jones Act was not meant to preclude general maritime claims or remedies, it does not follow that the Jones Act was meant to stop the development of general maritime law by the courts.  The Jones Act is significant because it created a statutory claim that is indistinguishable for present purposes from a general maritime law maintenance and cure claim based on personal injury and because this statutory claim does not permit the recovery of punitive damages.  \u201cCongress, in the exercise of its legislative powers, is free to say \u2018this much and no more,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201can admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.\u201d  Miles, supra, at 24, 27.  This policy embodied in the Jones Act thus constitutes a powerful argument in favor of the development of a similar rule under general maritime law.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That brings me to the Court\u2019s claim that the availability of punitive damages was established before the Jones Act was passed.  If punitive damages were a widely recognized and regularly employed feature of maintenance and cure claims during the pre-Jones Act era, I would not rule out the possibility that this history might be sufficient to outweigh the Miles uniformity principle.  But a search for cases in which punitive damages were awarded for the willful denial of maintenance of cure\u2014in an era when seamen were often treated with shocking callousness\u2014yields very little.  Although American courts have entertained maintenance and cure suits since the early 19th century, the Court points to only two reported cases\u2014The City of Carlisle, 39 F. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), and The Troop, 118 F. 769 (DC Wash. 1902)\u2014that, as the Court carefully puts it, \u201cappear to contain at least some punitive element.\u201d  Ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s choice of words is well advised, for it is not even clear that punitive damages were recovered in these two obscure cases.  In The City of Carlisle, a 16-year-old apprentice suffered a fractured skull.  The captain refused to put ashore.  Given little care, the apprentice spent the next six or seven weeks in his bunk, wracked with pain, and was then compelled to work 12 hours a day for the remaining three months of the voyage.  Upon landing, the captain made no arrangements for care and did not pay for the apprentice\u2019s brain surgery.  The apprentice received an award of $1,000; that may include some \u201cpunitive element,\u201d but it seems likely that much if not all of that sum represented compensation for the apprentice\u2019s months of agony and the lingering effects of his injury.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s second case, The Troop, supra, involved similarly brutal treatment.  The seaman fell from a mast and fractured an arm and a leg while his ship was six miles from its port of departure.  Refusing to return to port, the captain subjected the seaman to maltreatment for the remainder of the 36-day voyage.  As a result, he was required to undergo painful surgery, and his injuries permanently prevented him from returning to work as a mariner.  He received an undifferentiated award of $4,000, and while the court was sharply critical of the captain\u2019s conduct, it is far from clear that the award did not consist entirely of compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost future income, and pain and suffering.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the two cases cited by the Court, respondent and an amicus claim that punitive damages were awarded in a few additional cases.  See Brief for Respondent 13; Brief for Amicus Curiae American Assn. of Justice as Amicus Curiae 10\u201311.  Of these cases, The Margharita, 140 F. 820 (CA5 1905), is perhaps the most supportive.  There, the court explained that its award of $1,500 would not only \u201ccompensate the seaman for his unnecessary and unmerited suffering\u201d but would \u201cemphasize the importance of humane and correct judgment under the circumstances on the part of the master.\u201d  Id., at 827.  While the court\u2019s reference to the message that the award embodied suggests that the award was in part punitive, it is also possible that the reference simply represented a restatement of one of the traditional rationales for maintenance and cure, i.e., that it served the economic interests of shipowners and the general interests of the country by making service as a seaman more attractive.  See Harden v. Gordon, 11 F.\u00a0Cas. 480, 485 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining cases contain harsh criticism of the seamen\u2019s treatment but do not identify any portion of the award as punitive.  See The Rolph, 293 F.\u00a0269 (ND Cal. 1923), aff\u2019d, 299 F.\u00a052 (CA9 1924) (undifferentiated award of $10,000 for a seaman rendered blind in both eyes); Tomlinson v. Hewett, 24 F.\u00a0Cas. 29, 32 (No. 14,087) (DC Cal. 1872).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the search for maintenance and cure cases in which punitive damages were awarded yields strikingly slim results.  The cases found are insufficient in number, clarity, and prominence to justify departure from the Miles uniformity principle.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is one remaining question in this case, namely, whether punitive damages are permitted when a seaman asserts a general maritime law maintenance and cure claim that is not based on personal injury.  In Cortes, 287 U. S., at 371, the Court explained that the duty to furnish maintenance and cure \u201cis one annexed to the employment. . . .  Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin, but, given the relation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.\u201d  The duty is thus essentially quasicontractual, and therefore, in those instances in which the seaman does not suffer personal injury, recovery should be governed by the law of quasi-contract.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a74b, 12f (1979); Restatement of Restitution \u00a7\u00a7113\u2013114 (1936); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a74.2(3), pp 580 (2d ed. 1993).  Thus, an award of punitive damages is not appropriate.  See also Guevara, 59 F.\u00a03d, at 1513.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I would hold that punitive damages are not available in a case such as this, and I would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals."}, {"id": 1739, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1963004, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/557/404/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1739", "justia_text": "ATLANTIC SOUNDING CO., INC., et\u00a0al. v. \nTOWNSEND\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\nNo. 08\u2013214.\u2003Argued March 2, 2009\u2014Decided June 25, 2009\nAtlantic Sounding Co. allegedly refused to pay maintenance and cure to respondent Townsend for injuries he suffered while working on its tugboat, and then filed this declaratory relief action regarding its obligations.  Townsend filed suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law, alleging, inter alia, arbitrary and willful failure to provide maintenance and cure.  He filed similar counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the maintenance and cure claim.  The District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim, but certified the question for interlocutory appeal.  Following its precedent, the Eleventh Circuit held that punitive damages may be awarded for the willful withholding of maintenance and cure.\nHeld:\u00a0Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy under general maritime law, and because neither Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, nor the Jones Act altered this understanding, punitive damages for the willful and wanton disregard of the maintenance and cure obligation remain available as a matter of general maritime law.  Pp.\u00a02\u201319.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Settled legal principles establish three points central to this case.  Pp.\u00a02\u20139.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\u00a0Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.  English law during the colonial era accorded juries the authority to award such damages when warranted.  And American courts have likewise permitted such damages since at least 1784.  This Court has also found punitive damages authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.  See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363.  Pp.\u00a03\u20135.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii)\u00a0The common-law punitive damages tradition extends to claims arising under federal maritime law.  See Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108.  One of this Court\u2019s first cases so indicating involved an action for marine trespass.  See The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546.  And lower federal courts have found punitive damages available in maritime actions for particularly egregious tortious acts.  Pp.\u00a05\u20136.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iii)\u00a0Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rule\u2019s applicability in the maintenance and cure context.  The maintenance and cure obligation dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime law, and the failure of a seaman\u2019s employers to provide adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages in cases decided in the 1800\u2019s.  This Court has since registered its agreement with such decisions and has subsequently found that in addition to wages, \u201cmaintenance\u201d includes food and lodging at the ship\u2019s expense, and \u201ccure\u201d refers to medical treatment, Lewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441.  Moreover, an owner\u2019s failure to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided lower courts the impetus to award damages that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  Pp.\u00a07\u20138.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iv)\u00a0Under these settled legal principles, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation that departs from the common-law understanding.  P.\u00a09.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The plain language of the Jones Act does not provide a basis for overturning the common-law rule.  Congress enacted the Jones Act to overrule The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, where the Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers\u2019 negligence.  To that end, the Act created a statutory negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based on maintenance and cure.  The Act bestows the right to \u201celect\u201d to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamen\u2014not an exclusive remedy.  Because the then-accepted remedies arose from general maritime law, it necessarily follows that Congress envisioned their continued availability.  See Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354.  Had the Jones Act been the only remaining remedy available, there would have been no election to make.  And, the only statutory restrictions on general maritime maintenance and cure claims were enacted long after the Jones Act\u2019s passage and limit availability for only two discrete classes:\u00a0foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities and sailing school students and instructors.  This indicates that \u201cCongress knows how to\u201d restrict the traditional maintenance and cure remedy \u201cwhen it wants to.\u201d  Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106.  This Court has consistently observed that the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as maintenance and cure, see. e.g., The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110, and its case law supports the view that punitive damages awards, in particular, continue to remain available in maintenance and cure actions, see Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527.  Pp.\u00a09\u201313.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i)\u00a0Contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument, Miles does not limit recovery to the remedies available under the Jones Act.  Miles does not address either maintenance and cure actions in general or the availability of punitive damages for such actions.  Instead, it grappled with the entirely different question whether general maritime law should provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness.  The Court found that the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported recognition of a general maritime rule for wrongful death of a seaman.  However, since Congress had chosen to limit the damages available in the Jones Act and DOHSA, excluding damages for loss of society or lost future earnings, 498 U. S., at 21, 31\u201332, its judgment must control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, id., at 32\u201336.  Miles\u2019 reasoning does not apply here.  Unlike Miles\u2019 situation, both the general maritime cause of action here (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the Jones Act\u2019s passage.  And unlike Miles\u2019 facts, the Jones Act does not address the general maritime cause of action here or its remedy.  It is thus possible to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions and remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a matter to which \u201cCongress has spoken directly.\u201d  See id., at 31.  Moreover, petitioners\u2019 contrary view was directly rejected in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 820.  If Miles presented no barrier to the Garris Court\u2019s endorsement of a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, there is no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion here.  Like negligence, the duty of maintenance and cure and the general availability of punitive damages have been recognized \u201cfor more than a century,\u201d 532 U. S., at 820.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or \u201cexpand\u201d the maritime tort law\u2019s general principles, Miles does not require eliminating the general maritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure.  The fact that seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for maintenance and cure claims, does not mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy.  See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374\u2013375.  The laudable quest for uniformity in admiralty does not require narrowing available damages to the lowest common denominator approved by Congress for distinct causes of action.

EDGAR L. TOWNSEND\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 25, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question presented by this case is whether an injured seaman may recover punitive damages for his employer\u2019s willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.  Petitioners argue that under Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19 (1990), seamen may recover only those damages available under the Jones Act, 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730104.  We disagree.  Historically, punitive damages have been available and awarded in general maritime actions,\nincluding some in maintenance and cure.  We find\nthat nothing in Miles or the Jones Act eliminates that availability.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Edgar L. Townsend was a crew member of the Motor Tug Thomas.  After falling on the steel deck of the tugboat and injuring his arm and shoulder, respondent claimed that petitioner Atlantic Sounding,[Footnote 1] the owner of the tugboat, advised him that it would not provide maintenance and cure.  See 496 F.\u00a03d 1282, 1283 (CA11 2007).  \u201cA claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner\u2019s obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.\u201d  Lewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441 (2001).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners thereafter filed an action for declaratory relief regarding their obligations with respect to maintenance and cure.  Respondent filed his own suit under the Jones Act and general maritime law, alleging negligence, unseaworthiness, arbitrary and willful failure to pay maintenance and cure, and wrongful termination.  In addition, respondent filed similar counterclaims in the declaratory judgment action, seeking punitive damages for the denial of maintenance and cure.  The District Court consolidated the cases.  See 496 F.\u00a03d, at 1283\u20131284.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners moved to dismiss respondent\u2019s punitive damages claim.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that it was bound by the determination in Hines v. J.\u00a0A. LaPorte, Inc., 820 F.\u00a02d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) (per curiam), that punitive damages were available in an action for maintenance and cure.  The court, however, agreed to certify the question for interlocutory appeal.  See 496 F.\u00a03d, at 1284.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that Hines controlled and held that respondent could pursue his punitive damages claim for the willful withholding of maintenance and cure.  496 F.\u00a03d, at 1285\u20131286.  The decision conflicted with those of other Courts of Appeals, see, e.g., Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 59 F.\u00a03d 1496 (CA5 1995) (en banc); Glynn v. Roy Al Boat Management Corp., 57 F.\u00a03d 1495 (CA9 1995), and we granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent claims that he is entitled to seek punitive damages as a result of petitioners\u2019 alleged breach of their \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d duty under general maritime law.  We find no legal obstacle to his doing so.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.  Under English law during the colonial era, juries were accorded broad discretion to award damages as they saw fit.  See, e.g., Lord Townsend v. Hughes, 2 Mod. 150, 86 Eng. Rep. 994 (C.\u00a0P. 1676) (\u201c[I]n civil actions the plaintiff is to recover by way of compensation for the damages he hath sustained, and the jury are the proper judges thereof\u201d (emphasis in original)); 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages \u00a7349, p.\u00a0688 (9th ed. 1912) (hereinafter Sedgwick) (\u201cUntil comparatively recent times juries were as arbitrary judges of the amount of damages as of the facts\u201d).  The common-law view \u201cwas that \u2018in cases where the amount of damages was uncertain[,] their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury that the Court should not alter it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Feltner v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 353 (1998) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 480 (1935); alteration in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury\u2019s broad discretion to set damages included the authority to award punitive damages when the circumstances of the case warranted.  Just before the ratification of the Constitution, Lord Chief Justice Pratt explained that \u201ca jury ha[s] it in [its] power to give damages for more than the injury received.  Damages are designed not only as a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself.\u201d  Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 18\u201319, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498\u2013499 (C.\u00a0P. 1763); see also Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 25 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201c[P]unitive or \u2018exemplary\u2019 damages have long been a part of Anglo-American law\u201d); Huckle v. Money, 2 Wils. 205, 207, 95 Eng. Rep. 768, 769 (C.\u00a0P. 1763) (declining to grant a new trial because the jury \u201cha[s] done right in giving exemplary damages\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0American courts have likewise permitted punitive damages awards in appropriate cases since at least 1784.  See, e.g., Genay v. Norris, 1 S.\u00a0C.\u00a0L. 6, 7 (C.\u00a0P. and Gen. Sess. 1784) (approving award of \u201cvery exemplary damages\u201d because spiking wine represented a \u201cvery wanton outrage\u201d); Coryell v. Colbaugh, 1 N.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 77 (1791) (concluding that a breach of promise of marriage was \u201cof the most atrocious and dishonourable nature\u201d and supported \u201cdamages for example\u2019s sake, to prevent such offences in future\u201d (emphasis in original)).  Although some States elected not to allow juries to make such awards, the vast majority permitted them.  See 1 Sedgwick \u00a7\u00a7352, 354, at 694, 700.  By the middle of the 19th century, \u201cpunitive damages were undoubtedly an established part of the American common law of torts [and] no particular procedures were deemed necessary to circumscribe a jury\u2019s discretion regarding the award of such damages, or their amount.\u201d  Haslip, supra, at 26\u201327 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has also found the award of punitive damages to be authorized as a matter of common-law doctrine.  In Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363 (1852), for example, the Court recognized the \u201cwell-established principle of the common law, that in actions of trespass and all actions on the case for torts, a jury may inflict what are called exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages upon a defendant \u2026\u00a0.\u201d  Id., at 371; see also Philadelphia, W., & B.\u00a0R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214 (1859) (\u201cWhenever the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely or indignity, the jury are not limited to the ascertainment of a simple compensation for the wrong committed against the aggrieved person\u201d); Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 562 (1886) (\u201c[A]ccording to the settled law of this court, [a plaintiff] might show himself, by proof of the circumstances, to be entitled to exemplary damages calculated to vindicate his right and protect it against future similar invasions\u201d).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general rule that punitive damages were available at common law extended to claims arising under federal maritime law.  See Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108 (1893) (\u201c[C]ourts of admiralty \u2026 proceed, in cases of tort, upon the same principles as courts of common law, in allowing exemplary damages \u2026\u201d).  One of this Court\u2019s first cases indicating that punitive damages were available involved an action for marine trespass.  See The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546 (1818).  In the course of deciding whether to uphold the jury\u2019s award, Justice Story, writing for the Court, recognized that punitive damages are an available maritime remedy under the proper circumstances.  Although the Court found that the particular facts of the case did not warrant such an award against the named defendants, it explained that \u201cif this were a suit against the original wrong-doers, it might be proper to \u2026 visit upon them in the shape of exemplary damages, the proper punishment which belongs to such lawless misconduct.\u201d  Id., at 558; see also Barry, supra, at 563 (\u201cIn The Amiable Nancy, which was the case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story spoke of exemplary damages as \u2018the proper punish-\nment which belongs to \u2026 lawless misconduct\u2019\u00a0\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lower federal courts followed suit, finding that punitive damages were available in maritime actions for tortious acts of a particularly egregious nature.  See, e.g., McGuire v. The Golden Gate, 16 F. Cas. 141, 143 (No. 8,815) (CC ND Cal. 1856) (\u201cIn an action against the perpetrator of the wrong, the aggrieved party would be entitled to recover not only actual damages but exemplary,\u2014such as would vindicate his wrongs, and teach the tort feasor the necessity of reform\u201d); Ralston v. The State Rights, 20 F. Cas. 201, 210 (No. 11,540) (DC ED Pa. 1836) (\u201c[I]t is not legally correct \u2026 to say that a court cannot give exemplary damages, in a case like the present, against the owners of a vessel\u201d); Boston Mfg. Co. v. Fiske, 3 F.\u00a0Cas. 957 (No. 1,681) (CC Mass. 1820) (Story, J.) (\u201cIn cases of marine torts, or illegal captures, it is far from being uncommon in the admiralty to allow costs and expences, and to mulct the offending parties, even in exemplary damages, where the nature of the case requires it\u201d).  In short, prior to enactment of the Jones Act in 1920, \u201cmaritime jurisprudence was replete with judicial statements approving punitive damages, especially on behalf of passengers and seamen.\u201d  Robertson, Punitive Damages in American Maritime Law, 28 J. Mar. L. & Comm. 73, 115 (1997) (hereinafter Robertson); see also 2 Sedgwick \u00a7599b, at 1156 (\u201cExemplary damages are awarded in Admiralty, as in other jurisdictions\u201d); 2 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages \u00a7392, p.\u00a01272 (4th ed. 1916) (\u201cAs a rule a court of equity will not award [punitive] damages, but courts of admiralty will \u2026\u201d (footnote omitted)).[Footnote 2]\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in maritime law undermines the applicability of this general rule in the maintenance and cure context.  See G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty \u00a76\u201313, p.\u00a0312 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore & Black) (explaining that a seaman denied maintenance and cure \u201chas a free option to claim damages (including punitive damages) under a general maritime law count\u201d); Robertson 163 (concluding that breach of maintenance and cure is one of the particular torts for which general maritime law would most likely permit the awarding of punitive damages \u201cassuming \u2026 the requisite level of blameworthiness\u201d).  Indeed, the legal obligation to provide maintenance and cure dates back centuries as an aspect of general maritime law, and the failure of a seaman\u2019s employers to provide him with adequate medical care was the basis for awarding punitive damages in cases decided as early as the 1800\u2019s.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right to receive maintenance and cure was first recognized in this country in two lower court decisions authored by Justice Story.  See Harden v. Gordon, 11 F.\u00a0Cas. 480 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823); Reed v. Canfield, 20 F. Cas. 426 (No. 11,641) (CC Mass. 1832).  According to Justice Story, this common-law obligation to seamen was justified on humanitarian and economic grounds: \u201cIf some provision be not made for [seamen] in sickness at the expense of the ship, they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease, and poverty, and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment\u2026\u00a0. [T]he merchant himself derives an ultimate benefit [because i]t encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages with more promptitude, and at lower wages.\u201d  Harden, supra, at 483; see also Reed, supra, at 429 (\u201cThe seaman is to be cured at the expense of the ship, of the sickness or injury sustained in the ship\u2019s service\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has since registered its agreement with these decisions.  \u201cUpon a full review \u2026 of English and American authorities,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201cthe vessel and her owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, in the service of the ship, to the extent of his maintenance and cure, and to his wages, at least so long as the voyage is continued.\u201d  The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, 175 (1903).  Decisions following The Osceola have explained that in addition to wages, \u201cmaintenance\u201d includes food and lodging at the expense of their ship, and \u201ccure\u201d refers to medical treatment.  Lewis, 531 U. S., at 441; see also Gilmore & Black \u00a76\u201312, at 267\u2013268 (describing \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d as including medical expenses, a living allowance, and unearned wages).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the failure of a vessel owner to provide proper medical care for seamen has provided the impetus for damages awards that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  For example, in The City of Carlisle, 39 F. 807 (DC Ore. 1889), the court added $1,000 to its damages award to compensate an apprentice seaman for \u201cgross neglect and cruel maltreatment of the [seaman] since his injury.\u201d  Id., at 809, 817.  The court reviewed the indignities to which the apprentice had been subjected as he recovered without any serious medical attention, see id., at 810\u2013812, and explained that \u201cif owners do not wish to be mulct in damages for such misconduct, they should be careful to select men worthy to command their vessels and fit to be trusted with the safety and welfare of their crews, and particularly apprentice boys.\u201d  Id., at 817; see also The Troop, 118 F. 769, 770\u2013771, 773 (DC Wash. 1902) (explaining that $4,000 was a reasonable award because the captain\u2019s \u201cfailure to observe the dictates of humanity\u201d and obtain prompt medical care for an injured seaman constituted a \u201cmonstrous wrong\u201d).[Footnote 3]\nD\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The settled legal principles discussed above establish three points central to resolving this case.  First, punitive damages have long been available at common law.  Second, the common-law tradition of punitive damages extends to maritime claims.[Footnote 4]  And third, there is no evidence that claims for maintenance and cure were excluded from this general admiralty rule.  Instead, the pre-Jones Act evidence indicates that punitive damages remain available for such claims under the appropriate factual circumstances.  As a result, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages unless Congress has enacted legislation departing from this common-law understanding.  As explained below, it has not.\nIII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only statute that could serve as a basis for overturning the common-law rule in this case is the Jones Act.  Congress enacted the Jones Act primarily to overrule The Osceola, supra, in which this Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers\u2019 negligence.  To this end, the statute provides in relevant part:\n\u201cA seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the right of trial by jury, against the employer.  Laws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee apply to an action under this section.\u201d  46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730104(a) (incorporating the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a751\u201360).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jones Act thus created a statutory cause of action for negligence, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based on a seaman\u2019s right to maintenance and cure.  Section 30104 bestows upon the injured seaman the right to \u201celect\u201d to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice of actions for seamen\u2014not an exclusive remedy.  See Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language 798 (1913) (defining \u201celect\u201d as \u201c[t]o make choice of\u201d); 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary 979 (8th ed. 1914) (defining \u201celection\u201d as \u201c[c]hoice; selection\u201d).  Because the then-accepted remedies for injured seamen arose from general maritime law, see The Osceola, supra, at 175, it necessarily follows that Congress was envisioning the continued availability of those common-law causes of action.  See Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354 (1995) (\u201cCongress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove the bar to suit for negligence articulated in The Osceola, thereby completing the trilogy of heightened legal protections [including maintenance and cure] that seamen receive because of their exposure to the perils of the sea\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Stewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 487 (2005) (describing the Jones Act as \u201cremov[ing] this bar to negligence suits by seamen\u201d).  If the Jones Act had been the only remaining remedy available to injured seamen, there would have been no election to make.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the only statutory restrictions expressly addressing general maritime claims for maintenance and cure were enacted long after the passage of the Jones Act.  They limit its availability for two discrete classes of people: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see \u00a7503(a)(2), 96 Stat. 1955, codified at 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730105(b), and sailing school students and instructors, \u00a7204, 96 Stat. 1589, codified at 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a750504(b).  These provisions indicate that \u201cCongress knows how to\u201d restrict the traditional remedy of maintenance and cure \u201cwhen it wants to.\u201d  Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U. S. 97, 106 (1987).  Thus, nothing in the statutory scheme for maritime recovery restricts the availability of punitive damages for maintenance and cure for those, like respondent, who are not precluded from asserting the general maritime claim.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further supporting this interpretation of the Jones Act, this Court has consistently recognized that the Act \u201cwas remedial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are peculiarly the wards of admiralty.  Its purpose was to enlarge that protection, not to narrow it.\u201d  The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110, 123 (1936); see also American Export Lines, Inc. v. Alvez, 446 U. S. 274, 282 (1980) (plurality opinion) (declining to \u201cread the Jones Act as sweeping aside general maritime law remedies\u201d); O\u2019Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 43 (1943) (\u201cIt follows that the Jones Act, in extending a right of recovery to the seaman injured while in the service of his vessel by negligence, has done no more than supplement the remedy of maintenance and cure \u2026\u201d); Pacific S.\u00a0S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134, 138\u2013139 (1928) (holding that the Jones Act \u201cwas not intended to restrict in any way the long-established right of a seaman to maintenance, cure and wages\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only have our decisions repeatedly observed that the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such as maintenance and cure, but our case law also supports the view that punitive damages awards, in particular, remain available in maintenance and cure actions after the Act\u2019s passage.  In Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527 (1962), for example, the Court permitted the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees for the \u201ccallous\u201d and \u201cwillful and persistent\u201d refusal to pay maintenance and cure.  Id., at 529\u2013531.  In fact, even the Vaughan dissenters, who believed that such fees were generally unavailable, agreed that a seaman \u201cwould be entitled to exemplary damages in accord with traditional concepts of the law of damages\u201d where a \u201cshipowner\u2019s refusal to pay maintenance stemmed from a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal rights of the seaman.\u201d  Id., at 540 (opinion of Stewart, J.); see also Fiske, 3 F.\u00a0Cas., at 957 (Story, J.) (arguing that counsel fees are awardable in \u201c[c]ourts of admiralty \u2026 not technically as costs, but upon the same principles, as they are often allowed damages in cases of torts, by courts of common law, as a recompense for injuries sustained, as exemplary damages, or as a remuneration for expences incurred, or losses sustained, by the misconduct of the other party\u201d).[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the text of the Jones Act or this Court\u2019s decisions issued in the wake of its enactment undermines the continued existence of the common-law cause of action providing recovery for the delayed or improper provision of maintenance and cure.  Petitioners do not deny the availability of punitive damages in general maritime law, or identify any cases establishing that such damages were historically unavailable for breach of the duty of maintenance and cure.  The plain language of the Jones Act, then, does not provide the punitive damages bar that petitioners seek.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners nonetheless argue that the availability of punitive damages in this case is controlled by the Jones Act because of this Court\u2019s decision in Miles, 498 U. S. 19; see also post, at 5\u20136 (opinion of Alito, J.).  In Miles, petitioners argue, the Court limited recovery in maritime cases involving death or personal injury to the remedies available under the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a730301\u201330306.[Footnote 6]  Petitioners\u2019 reading of Miles is far too broad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miles does not address either maintenance and cure actions in general or the availability of punitive damages for such actions.  The decision instead grapples with the entirely different question whether general maritime law should provide a cause of action for wrongful death based on unseaworthiness.  By providing a remedy for wrongful death suffered on the high seas or in territorial waters, the Jones Act and DOHSA displaced a general maritime rule that denied any recovery for wrongful death.  See Miles, 498 U. S., at 23\u201334. This Court, therefore, was called upon in Miles to decide whether these new statutes supported an expansion of the relief available under pre-existing general maritime law to harmonize it with a cause of action created by statute.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Miles first concluded that the \u201cunanimous legislative judgment behind the Jones Act, DOHSA, and the many state statutes\u201d authorizing maritime wrongful-death actions, supported the recognition of a general maritime action for wrongful death of a seaman.  Id., at 24 (discussing Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375 (1970), which overruled The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199 (1886)).  Congress had chosen to limit, however, the damages available for wrongful-death actions under the Jones Act and DOHSA, such that damages were not statutorily available for loss of society or lost future earnings.  See Miles, 498 U. S., at 21, 31\u201332.  The Court thus concluded that Congress\u2019 judgment must control the availability of remedies for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, id., at 32\u201336.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reasoning of Miles remains sound.  As the Court in that case explained, \u201c[w]e no longer live in an era when seamen and their loved ones must look primarily to the courts as a source of substantive legal protection from injury and death; Congress and the States have legislated extensively in these areas.\u201d  Id., at 27.  Furthermore, it was only because of congressional action that a general federal cause of action for wrongful death on the high seas and in territorial waters even existed; until then, there was no general common-law doctrine providing for such an action.  As a result, to determine the remedies available under the common-law wrongful-death action, \u201can admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.\u201d  Ibid.  It would have been illegitimate to create common-law remedies that exceeded those remedies statutorily available under the Jones Act and DOHSA.  See id., at 36 (\u201cWe will not create, under our admiralty powers, a remedy \u2026 that goes well beyond the limits of Congress\u2019 ordered system of recovery for seamen\u2019s injury and death\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But application of that principle here does not lead to the outcome suggested by petitioners or the dissent.  See post, at 2\u20133.  Unlike the situation presented in Miles, both the general maritime cause of action (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the passage of the Jones Act.  See supra, at 3\u20138.  Also unlike the facts presented by Miles, the Jones Act does not address maintenance and cure or its remedy.[Footnote 7]  It is therefore possible to adhere to the traditional understanding of maritime actions and remedies without abridging or violating the Jones Act; unlike wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a matter to which \u201cCongress has spoken directly.\u201d  See Miles, supra, at 31 (citing Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618, 625 (1978)).  Indeed, the Miles Court itself acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Jones Act evinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime law,\u201d 498 U. S., at 29, and noted that statutory remedy limitations \u201cwould not necessarily deter us, if recovery \u2026 were more consistent with the general principles of maritime tort law.\u201d  Id., at 35.  The availability of punitive damages for maintenance and cure actions is entirely faithful to these \u201cgeneral principles of maritime tort law,\u201d and no statute casts doubt on their availability under general maritime law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, petitioners\u2019 contention that Miles precludes any action or remedy for personal injury beyond that made available under the Jones Act was directly rejected by this Court in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001).  That case involved the death of a harbor worker.  Ibid.  There, the Court recognized a maritime cause of action for wrongful death attributable to negligence although neither the Jones Act (which applies only to seamen) nor DOHSA (which does not cover territorial waters) provided such a remedy.  Id., at 817\u2013818.  The Court acknowledged that \u201cit will be the better course, in many cases that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress.\u201d  Id., at 820.  But the Court concluded that the cause of action at issue there was \u201cnew only in the most technical sense\u201d because \u201c[t]he general maritime law has recognized the tort of negligence for more than a century, and it has been clear since Moragne that breaches of a maritime duty are actionable when they cause death, as when they cause injury.\u201d  Ibid.  The Court thus found that \u201cCongress\u2019s occupation of this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recognizing what is already logically compelled by our precedents.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Miles presented no barrier to this endorsement of a previously unrecognized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, we see no legitimate basis for a contrary conclusion in the present case.  Like negligence, \u201c[t]he general maritime law has recognized \u2026 for more than a century\u201d the duty of maintenance and cure and the general availability of punitive damages.  See Garris, supra, at 820; see also supra, at 3\u20138.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory text or \u201cexpand\u201d the general principles of maritime tort law, Miles does not require us to eliminate the general maritime remedy of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty to pay maintenance and cure.  \u201cWe assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,\u201d Miles, supra, at 32, and the available history suggests that punitive damages were an established part of the maritime law in 1920, see supra, at 5\u20138.[Footnote 8]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It remains true, of course, that \u201c[a]dmiralty is not created in a vacuum; legislation has always served as an important source of both common law and admiralty principles.\u201d  Miles, supra, at 24.  And it also is true that the negligent denial of maintenance and cure may also be the subject of a Jones Act claim.  See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367 (1932).[Footnote 9]  But the fact that seamen commonly seek to recover under the Jones Act for the wrongful withholding of maintenance and cure does not mean that the Jones Act provides the only remedy for maintenance and cure claims.  Indeed, contrary to petitioners\u2019 view that the Jones Act replaced in their entirety the remedies available at common law for maintenance and cure, the Cortes decision explicitly acknowledged a seaman\u2019s right to choose among overlapping statutory and common-law remedies for injuries sustained by the denial of maintenance and cure.  See 287 U. S., at 374\u2013375 (A seaman\u2019s \u201ccause of action for personal injury created by the statute may have overlapped his cause of action for breach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure \u2026\u00a0.  In such circumstances it was his privilege, in so far as the causes of action covered the same ground, to sue indifferently on any one of them\u201d).[Footnote 10]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this Court has repeatedly explained, \u201cremedies for negligence, unseaworthiness, and maintenance and cure have different origins and may on occasion call for application of slightly different principles and procedures.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 18 (1963); see also Peterson, 278 U. S., at 138, 139 (emphasizing that a seaman\u2019s action for maintenance and cure is \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d from other claims such as negligence and that the maintenance and cure right is \u201cin no sense inconsistent with, or an alternative of, the right to recover compensatory damages [under the Jones Act]\u201d).  See also Gilmore & Black \u00a76\u201323, at 342 (\u201cIt is unquestioned law that both the Jones Act and the unseaworthiness remedies are additional to maintenance and cure: the seaman may have maintenance and cure and also one of the other two\u201d).  The laudable quest for uniformity in admiralty does not require the narrowing of available damages to the lowest common denominator approved by Congress for distinct causes of action.[Footnote 11]  Although \u201c\u00a0Congress \u2026 is free to say this much and no more,\u201d Miles, 498 U. S., at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted), we will not attribute words to Congress that it has not written. \nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because punitive damages have long been an accepted remedy under general maritime law, and because nothing in the Jones Act altered this understanding, such damages for the willful and wanton disregard of the maintenance and cure obligation should remain available in the appropriate case as a matter of general maritime law.[Footnote 12]  Limiting recovery for maintenance and cure to whatever is permitted by the Jones Act would give greater pre-emptive effect to the Act than is required by its text, Miles, or any of this Court\u2019s other decisions interpreting the statute.  For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of Weeks Marine, Inc., the other petitioner in this case.\n\u00a0Although punitive damages awards were rarely upheld on judicial review, but see Roza v. Smith, 65 F. 592, 596\u2013597 (DC ND Cal. 1895); Gallagher v. The Yankee, 9 F.\u00a0Cas. 1091, 1093 (No. 5,196) (DC ND Cal. 1859), that fact does not draw into question the basic understanding that punitive damages were considered an available maritime remedy.  Indeed, in several cases in which a judgment awarding punitive damage awards was overturned on appeal, the reversal was based on unrelated grounds.  See, e.g., The Margharita, 140 F. 820, 824 (CA5 1905); Pacific Packing & Nav. Co. v. Fielding, 136 F. 577, 580 (CA9 1905); Latchtimacker v. Jacksonville Towing & Wrecking Co., 181 F. 276, 278 (CC SD Fla. 1910).\n\u00a0Although these cases do not refer to \u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cexemplary\u201d damages, scholars have characterized the awards authorized by these decisions as such.  See Robertson 103\u2013105; Edelman, Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp.: Opposing the Decision, 20 Tulane Mar. L.\u00a0J. 349, 351, and n.\u00a022 (1996).\n\u00a0The dissent correctly notes that the handful of early cases involving maintenance and cure, by themselves, do not definitively resolve the question of punitive damages availability in such cases.  See post, at 6\u20138 (opinion of Alito, J.).  However, it neglects to acknowledge that the general common-law rule made punitive damages available in maritime actions.  See supra, at 5\u20136.  Nor does the dissent explain why maintenance and cure actions should be excepted from this general rule.  It is because of this rule, and the fact that these early cases support\u2014rather than refute\u2014its application to maintenance and cure actions, see supra, at 7\u20138, that the pre-Jones Act evidence supports the conclusion that punitive damages were available at common law where the denial of maintenance and cure involved wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.\n\u00a0In the wake of Vaughan, a number of lower courts expressly held that punitive damages can be recovered for the denial of maintenance and cure.  See, e.g., Hines v. J.\u00a0A. Laporte, Inc., 820 F.\u00a02d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) (per curiam) (upholding punitive damages award of $5,000 for an \u201carbitrary and bad faith breach of the duty to furnish maintenance and cure\u201d); Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc., 477 F. 2d 1048, 1049\u20131052 (CA1 1973) (affirming punitive damages award of $10,000 which was based, in part, on the defendant\u2019s initial withholding of maintenance and cure on the pretext that the seaman had been fired for cause).\n\u00a0DOHSA applies only to individuals killed (not merely injured) by conduct on the high seas.  See 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730302.  Because this case involves injuries to a seaman, and not death on the high seas, DOHSA is not relevant.\n\u00a0Respondent\u2019s claim is not affected by the statutory amendments to the Jones Act that limit maintenance and cure recovery in cases involving foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730105, or sailing school students and instructors, \u00a750504.  See supra, at 11.\n\u00a0In light of the Court\u2019s decision in Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 818 (2001), our reading of Miles cannot, as the dissent contends, represent an \u201cabrup[t]\u201d change of course.  See post, at 1.\n\u00a0For those maintenance and cure claims that do not involve personal injury (and thus cannot be asserted under the Jones Act), the dissent argues that punitive damages should be barred because such claims are based in contract, not tort.  See post, at 8.  But the right of maintenance and cure \u201cwas firmly established in the maritime law long before recognition of the distinction between tort and contract.\u201d  O\u2019Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 318 U. S. 36, 42 (1943).  Although the right has been described as incident to contract, it cannot be modified or waived.  See Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 372 (1932).\n\u00a0The fact that, in some cases, a violation of the duty of maintenance and cure may also give rise to a Jones Act claim, see post, at 3 (opinion of Alito, J.), is significant only in that it requires admiralty courts to ensure against double recovery.  See Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 18\u201319 (1963) (authorizing a jury trial when a maintenance and cure claim is joined with a Jones Act claim because, \u201c[r]equiring a seaman to split up his lawsuit, submitting part of it to a jury and part to a judge \u2026 can easily result in too much or too little recovery\u201d).  Thus, a court may take steps to ensure that any award of damages for lost wages in a Jones Act negligence claim is offset by the amount of lost wages awarded as part of a recovery of maintenance and cure.  See, e.g., Petition of Oskar Tiedemann & Co., 367 F.\u00a02d 498, 505, n.\u00a06 (CA3 1966); Crooks v. United States, 459 F.\u00a02d 631, 633 (CA9 1972).\n\u00a0Although this Court has recognized that it may change maritime law in its operation as an admiralty court, see Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 271 (1979), petitioners have not asked the Court to do so in this case or pointed to any serious anomalies, with respect to the Jones Act or otherwise, that our holding may create.  Nor have petitioners argued that the size of punitive damages awards in maintenance and cure cases necessitates a recovery cap, which the Court has elsewhere imposed.  See Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 42) (imposing a punitive-to-compensatory ratio of 1:1).  We do not decide these issues.\n\u00a0Because we hold that Miles does not render the Jones Act\u2019s damages provision determinative of respondent\u2019s remedies, we do not address the dissent\u2019s argument that the Jones Act, by incorporating the provisions of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, see 46 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a730104(a), prohibits the recovery of punitive damages in actions under that statute.

The CSB did not certify because the results of the test would have promoted a disproportionate number of white candidates in comparison to minority candidates. The plaintiffs argued that their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e, and the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause were violated. The federal district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. It reasoned that the CSB, by refusing to certify the results of the promotional exam, was trying to fulfill its obligations under the rules utilized by the plaintiffs in their argument and therefore was protected in its actions.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Can a municipality reject results from an otherwise valid civil service exam when the results unintentionally prevent the promotion of minority candidates?</p>\n<p>2) Does 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e permit federal courts to relieve municipalities from having to comply with local laws that require strict compliance with race-blind merit selection procedures?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Maybe; fact dependent. Not answered. The Supreme Court held that by discarding the exams, the City of New Haven violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito. Before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the purpose of avoiding a \"disparate impact\" on a protected trait (race, color, religion, national origin), the employer must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" that it will be subject to \"disparate impact liability\" if it fails to take the discriminatory action. Here, the Court reasoned that New Haven failed to prove it had a \"strong basis in evidence\" that failing to discard the results of the exam would have subjected it to liability, as the exams were job-related, consistent with business necessity, and there was no evidence that an equally-valid, less-discriminatory alternative was available.</p>\n<p>Justice Scalia wrote separately, concurring. He noted that the Court avoided answering whether the \"disparate impact\" provision of Title VII was consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Alito also wrote a concurring opinion and was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. He criticized the dissent for omitting key information in reaching its alternate conclusion.</p>\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer. She argued that the City of New Haven had good cause to believe it would be vulnerable to a Title VII lawsuit if it certified the exams. Moreover, she criticized the majority for ignoring \"substantial flaws\" in the exam.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25151, "name": "Gregory S.

(FBL) under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) alleging he was demoted because of his age. A federal district court in Iowa found in his favor and awarded him $46, 945.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and ordered a new trial. The court held that the jury instruction in Mr. Gross' case was improper. It reasoned that since Mr. Gross never submitted direct evidence that age was a motivating factor in his demotion, he was not entitled to a jury instruction that put the burden of persuasion upon FBL to show that it would have demoted him regardless of his age.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does a plaintiff need to submit direct evidence of discrimination in a suit filed under the ADEA in order to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court held that in an ADEA discrimination claim the burden of persuasion does not shift to the defendant employer to prove that it would have taken the action regardless of the plaintiff's age, even when evidence is introduced showing that age was one motivating factor in its decision. Rather, the Court held that the plaintiff must prove by a \"preponderance of the evidence\" that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the defendant's action. With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned from the ADEA's plain text and Congressional intent that the Title VII burden shifting framework did not apply to the ADEA.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens dissented and was joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer. He argued that both the Court and Congress had previously rejected the \"but for\" standard of causation in ADEA claims and then criticized the majority for \"unnecessary lawmaking.\" Justice Breyer also wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg. He criticized the majority for adopting a standard that was inappropriate for determining mental processes like motive, a necessary element in a ADEA discrimination claim.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 23226, "name": "Eric Schnapper", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/eric_schnapper", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Schnapper", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "eric_schnapper"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19725"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 19760, "name": "Carter G.

In exchange for his guilty plea, the government agreed to recommend a reduced sentence. However at sentencing, the government reneged arguing that because Mr. Puckett admittedly aided a fellow inmate in another crime while awaiting sentencing, he was no longer eligible for the reduction. The district court agreed. On appeal, Mr. Puckett maintained that the government's breach of agreement disqualified his guilty plea.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Puckett's guilty plea was not disqualified. It recognized that the government breached its plea agreement at sentencing. However, it reasoned that Mr. Puckett failed to prove his substantial rights were affected when the district court was unlikely to have imposed a different sentence, even if the government had recommended a reduction.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does Rule 52(b) in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the \"plain error standard\", govern whether a defendant can claim the government breached a plea agreement at the appellate level, when he failed to do so at the trial level?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. With Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court held that the \"plain error standard\" governs claims that are forfeited because they were not raised at trial in determining whether they may be raised at the appellate level. The Court then reaffirmed the four-pronged \"plain-error\" standard of review: \"1) there must be an error or defect that the appellant has not affirmatively waived, 2) it must be clear and obvious, 3) it must have affected the appellant's substantial rights, 4) if the three other prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Here, the Court rejected Mr. Puckett's arguments that he should not be subject to the \"plain-error\" standard after he failed to raise his claims at the trial level. Moreover, it affirmed his conviction and sentencing, agreeing with the Fifth Circuit's reasoning that Mr. Puckett's \"substantial rights\" had not been affected.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, wrote a separate dissenting opinion. He agreed that the \"plain-error\" standard was appropriate in Mr. Puckett's case. However, he criticized the majority for interpreting the \"plain-error\" standard's third prong requirement of affecting the appellant's \"substantial rights\" to only include his \"length of incarceration.\" Rather, Justice Souter argued that Mr. Puckett's substantial rights were affected when he was convicted without trial and by a plea agreement that was not honored by the government. Therefore, Mr. Puckett was entitled to relief.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 34630, "name": "Lars R.

After unsuccessfully appealing his case through the Tennessee courts, a federal district court appointed Mr. Harbison a federal public defender to represent him in filing a federal habeas corpus petition. That petition was denied by the both the federal district court as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. As Tennessee law does not authorize the appointment of state public defenders as counsel in state clemency proceedings, Mr. Harbison's federal public defender requested to represent him in his state clemency proceedings. Both the district court and Sixth Circuit denied the request, holding that federal law does not authorize federal compensation for legal representation in state matters.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) According to 28 U.S.C. Section 2254, is a certificate of appealability required to appeal an order denying a request for federally-funded counsel?</p>\n<p>2) Does 18 U.S.C. Section 3599 permit federally-funded habeas counsel to represent a condemned inmate in state clemency proceedings when the state has denied state-funded counsel for that purpose?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No and Yes. First, the Supreme Court held that a certificate of appealability (COA) is not required to appeal an order denying a request for federally appointed counsel. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority, and joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court reasoned that a COA is only required to appeal final orders in habeas corpus petitions. Here, Mr. Harbison did not require a COA because he merely appealed an order denying his request to expand the authority of his federally appointed counsel. Second, the Supreme Court held that federally appointed counsel may represent their clients in state clemency proceedings and are entitled to compensation for such representation. The Court stated that the plain language of 18 U.S.C. Section 3599 authorized federally appointed counsel to represent their clients in those proceedings \"as may become available to the defendant\", reasoning that state clemency proceedings met this description.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas each wrote separately concurring in the judgment. Justice Antonin G. Scalia, joined by Justice Samuel A. Alito, concurred in part and dissented in part. He agreed that a COA was not required to appeal an order denying the expansion of a federally appointed counsel's authority. However, he disagreed that 18 U.S.C. Section 3599 authorizes state prisoners' federally funded counsel to pursue state clemency on their clients' behalf.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 45148, "name": "William M.

The district court determined that the 100:1 weight ratio for sentencing crack cocaine and powder cocaine that the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (Guidelines) used was excessive given the circumstances, so the district court instead based its ruling on a 20:1 ratio. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the district court could not decide what ratio it wanted to apply for conviction and remanded Spears case for retrial and sentencing. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States</em>, in which the Court held that the Guidelines were advisory and that a district court does not abuse its discretion by varying from the Guidelines\u2019 prescribed ratio due to disagreement with the disparity the Guidelines create between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. On remand, the appellate court again held that the district court erred in categorically rejecting the Guidelines\u2019 ratio and substituting its own.</p>\n", "question": "<p>May a district court vary from the advisory ratio of cocaine base to cocaine powder used in the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual when determining sentencing due to a disagreement with the disparity the Guidelines create?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>In a per curiam opinion, the majority held that the ratio the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual uses for sentencing crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions are not binding. Previous precedent had established that, not only may district courts vary from the Guidelines\u2019 ratio based on a case-specific determination, but they may also do so based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines and the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine that the ratio in question creates. Therefore, the Court held that the district court did not err is using a 20:1 ratio rather than an 100:1 ratio in this case.</p>\n<p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy would have set the case for oral argument.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented without writing an opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. wrote a dissent arguing that it is not the role of the Court to determine if the appellate courts are correctly following protocol. He wrote that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit should have been given more time to rule in Spears\u2019 case rather than having the case be decided by the Supreme Court. Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. joined the dissent.</p>\n", "advocates": null, "oral_argument_audio": null, "citation": {"volume": "555", "page": "261", "year": "2009", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/19488"}, "decisions": [{"description": "The sentencing guidelines for sentencing crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions are not binding.", "votes": [{"member": {"ID": 15086, "name": "John G.

UNITED STATES\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\nNo. 08\u20135721.\u2003Decided January 21, 2009\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dissent from the Court\u2019s summary reversal in this case.  As explained by the majority here and the dissenting judges below, there are cogent arguments that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision was contrary to our decision last Term in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).  But I do not think any error is so apparent as to warrant the bitter medicine of summary reversal, and I think there are good reasons not to address the question presented at this time.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the decision below, the Court of Appeals recognized Kimbrough\u2019s core holding that district courts have authority to depart from the Guidelines based on policy concerns:  \u201cIn considering the overall goals of sentencing under [18 U. S.\u00a0C.] \u00a73553(a) and conducting an individualized assessment based upon the particular circumstances of a defendant\u2019s case, a district court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than necessary.\u201d  533 F.\u00a03d 715, 717 (CA8 2008). This petition involves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts that do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may adopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in place of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is at least some language in Kimbrough that seems to support the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding.  In Kimbrough, we noted with apparent approval that the District Court \u201cdid not purport to establish a ratio of its own.\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (emphasis added).  Rather, we held, the District Court \u201cappropriately framed its final determination in line with \u00a73553(a)\u2019s overarching instruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \u00a73553(a)(2).\u201d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of this language.  See United States v. Russell, 537 F.\u00a03d 6, 11 (CA1 2008) (emphasizing \u201cthe importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing determinations, rather than a reliance on generalized ratios\u201d); United States v. Gunter, 527 F.\u00a03d 282, 286 (CA3 2008) (\u201ca district court may not employ a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 approach that categorically rejects the crack/powder disparity without an individualized assessment of the \u00a73553(a) factors\u201d).  The majority cites no circuit court decision contrary to that of the Eighth Circuit in this case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not the stuff of summary reversal.  The majority may well be correct that its holding today follows from Kimbrough, but it is not clear to me that this result was part and parcel of the holding in that case, especially in light of the language quoted above.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, I do not believe this case meets our normal criteria for plenary consideration.  As noted, there is no split in the lower courts on the question whether a district court may replace the crack-powder ratio in the Guidelines with a categorical ratio of the court\u2019s own choosing.  And, as explained above, I do not think the Court of Appeals has \u201cso far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for an exercise of this Court\u2019s supervisory power.\u201d  S.\u00a0Ct. Rule 10(a).  In other words, this is exactly the sort of issue that could benefit from further attention in the courts of appeals.  We should not rush to answer a novel question about the application of a one-year-old decision in the absence of a pronounced conflict among the circuits.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough have given the lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively short period.  We should give them some time to address the nuances of these precedents before adding new ones.  As has been said, a plant cannot grow if you constantly yank it out of the ground to see if the roots are healthy."}, {"id": 1786, "title": "Opinion of the Court", "author": null, "type": {"value": "majority", "label": "Opinion of the Court"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962859, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/261/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1786", "justia_text": "STEVEN SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\nNo. 08\u20135721.\u2003Decided January 21, 2009\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steven Spears was found guilty of conspiracy to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base and at least 500 grams of powder cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), 846.  At sentencing, the District Court determined that the drug quantities attributable to Spears yielded an offense level of 38, that his criminal history justified placing him in the Guidelines\u2019 criminal history category IV, and that the resulting advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment.  The District Court was of the view that the Guidelines\u2019 100:1 ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine quantities, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2006) (USSG),* yielded an excessive sentence in light of the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a).  Relying in part on decisions from other District Courts, see United States v. Perry, 389 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 278, 307\u2013308 (RI 2005); United States v. Smith, 359 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 771, 781\u2013782 (ED Wis. 2005), which in turn relied on a report from the Sentencing Commission criticizing the 100:1 ratio, see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 106\u2013107, App. A, pp.\u00a03\u20136 (May 2002) (hereinafter Report to Congress), the District Court recalculated Spears\u2019 offense level based on a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio.  That yielded an offense level of 34 and a sentencing range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.  The District Court sentenced Spears to 240 months in prison, the statutory mandatory minimum.  See United States v. Spears, 469 F.\u00a03d 1166, 1173\u20131174 (CA8 2006) (en banc) (Spears I).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On cross-appeal, the Government argued that \u201cthe district court erred by categorically rejecting the 100:1 quantity ratio and substituting its own ratio in calculating Spears\u2019s sentence.\u201d  Id., at 1174.  The Eighth Circuit reversed Spears\u2019 sentence and remanded for resentencing, holding that \u201cneither Booker nor \u00a73553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the 100:1 quantity ratio and use a different ratio in sentencing defendants for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d  Id., at 1176.  This Court vacated the judgment of the Eighth Circuit, and remanded for further consideration in light of Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).  Spears v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Eighth Circuit again reversed Spears\u2019 sentence and remanded for resentencing.  533 F.\u00a03d 715, 716 (2008) (en banc) (Spears II).  It concluded, again, that the District Court \u201cmay not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines,\u201d id., at 717, and \u201c\u00a0\u2018impermissibly varied by replacing the 100:1 quantity ratio inherent in the advisory Guidelines range with a 20:1 quantity ratio,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ibid. (quoting Spears I, supra, at 1178).  Spears again petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  Because the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision on remand conflicts with our decision in Kimbrough, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Kimbrough, we held that \u201cunder Booker, the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only,\u201d 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a73553(a)\u2019s purpose, even in a mine-run case,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (emphasis added).  The correct interpretation of that holding is the one offered by the dissent in Spears II:\n\u201cThe Court thus established that even when a particular defendant in a crack cocaine case presents no special mitigating circumstances\u2014no outstanding service to country or community, no unusually disadvantaged childhood, no overstated criminal history score, no post-offense rehabilitation\u2014a sentencing court may nonetheless vary downward from the advisory guideline range.  The court may do so based solely on its view that the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentencing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine creates \u2018an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of \u00a73553(a),\u2019 and is \u2018at odds with \u00a73553(a).\u2019  The only fact necessary to justify such a variance is the sentencing court\u2019s disagreement with the guidelines\u2014its policy view that the 100-to-1 ratio creates an unwarranted disparity.\u201d  533 F.\u00a03d, at 719 (opinion of Colloton, J.) (citations omitted).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kimbrough considered and rejected the position taken by the Eighth Circuit below.  It noted that \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case \u2018outside the \u201cheartland\u201d to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20\u201321) (quoting Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 351 (2007)).  The implication was that an \u201cinside the heartland\u201d departure (which is necessarily based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines and necessarily disagrees on a \u201ccategorical basis\u201d) may be entitled to less respect.  Our opinion said, however, that the \u201ccrack cocaine Guidelines \u2026 present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commission\u2019s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  Kimbrough thus holds that with respect to the crack cocaine Guidelines, a categorical disagreement with and variance from the Guidelines is not suspect.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was indeed the point of Kimbrough: a recognition of district courts\u2019 authority to vary from the crack cocaine Guidelines based on policy disagreement with them, and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.  The latter proposition was already established pre-Kimbrough, see United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 245\u2013246 (2005), and the Government conceded as much in Kimbrough.  552 U. S., at ___, n.\u00a013 (slip op., at 13, n.\u00a013).  That the Government did not prevail in Kimbrough proves that its concession\u2014\u201cthat a district court may vary from the 100:1 ratio if it does so \u2018based on the individualized circumstance[s]\u2019 of a particular case,\u201d ibid.\u2014understated the extent of district courts\u2019 sentencing discretion. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In drawing a distinction between \u201cindividualized, case-specific\u201d consideration of the Guidelines\u2019 ratio and categorical rejection and replacement of that ratio, the Eighth Circuit relied in part, Spears II, supra, at 717, on the following passage from Kimbrough: \n\u201cThe [district] court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own.  Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with \u00a73553(a)\u2019s overarching instruction to \u2018impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \u00a73553(a)(2).\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).\n\nThis says that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for the District Court in Kimbrough not to specify what ratio it was using, but merely to proceed with \u00a73553(a) analysis.  The Eighth Circuit read that to mean that district courts, in the course of their individualized determinations, may not categorically disagree with the Guidelines ratio, and (consequently) may not substitute their own ratio for that of the Guidelines.  If it meant that, our vacating of the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment in Spears I would have been inexplicable, because that supposedly impermissible disagreement and substitution was precisely the reason for Spears I\u2019s reversal of the District Court.  See Spears I, 469 F.\u00a03d, at 1175\u20131176.  As a logical matter, of course, rejection of the 100:1 ratio, explicitly approved by Kimbrough, necessarily implies adoption of some other ratio to govern the mine-run case.  A sentencing judge who is given the power to reject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ratio must also possess the power to apply a different ratio which, in his judgment, corrects the disparity.  Put simply, the ability to reduce a mine-run defendant\u2019s sentence necessarily permits adoption of a replacement ratio.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent the above quoted language has obscured Kimbrough\u2019s holding, we now clarify that district courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the crack-cocaine Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those Guidelines.  Here, the District Court\u2019s choice of replacement ratio was based upon two well-reasoned decisions by other courts, which themselves reflected the Sentencing Commission\u2019s expert judgment that a 20:1 ratio would be appropriate in a mine-run case.  See Perry, 389 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 307\u2013308; Smith, 359 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 781\u2013782; Report to Congress 106\u2013107, App. A, pp.\u00a03\u20136.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The alternative approach\u2014adopted by the Eighth Circuit\u2014would likely yield one of two results.  Either district courts would treat the Guidelines\u2019 policy embodied in the crack-to-powder ratio as mandatory, believing that they are not entitled to vary based on \u201ccategorical\u201d policy disagreements with the Guidelines, or they would continue to vary, masking their categorical policy disagreements as \u201cindividualized determinations.\u201d  The latter is institutionalized subterfuge.  The former contradicts our holding in Kimbrough.  Neither is an acceptable sentencing practice.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In opposing Spears\u2019 present petition for a writ of certiorari, the Government contends that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion stands only for the noncontroversial proposition that a remand for resentencing was warranted in this case because the District Court did not properly consider all of the \u00a73553(a) sentencing factors.  Brief in Opposition 12\u201313.  But the Government did not present that argument below, and the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion plainly did not rest on that ground.  It concluded instead that \u201cthe district court may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the Guidelines.\u201d  Spears II, 533 F.\u00a03d, at 717.  The Eighth Circuit has since read its own opinion to mean what it says, see United States v. Judon, 284 Fed. Appx. 371, 372 (2008) (per curiam), and so do we.  In any event, to the extent the District Court cut short its sentencing analysis, it did so only because it had already determined that a mandatory minimum sentence was required, thus mooting any further arguments for a reduced sentence.  The decision not to entertain pointless arguments hardly constitutes procedural error.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent contends, post, at 1, that the Eighth Circuit recognized Kimbrough\u2019s core holding when it stated that in conducting \u201can individualized assessment based upon the particular circumstances of a defendant\u2019s case, a district court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than necessary,\u201d  Spears II, supra, at 717.  But that was not Kimbrough\u2019s holding; it was the Government\u2019s position in Kimbrough, which did not prevail.  And it is expressly contradicted by Kimbrough\u2019s holding that district courts are entitled to vary from the crack-cocaine guidelines in a mine-run case where there are no \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d that would otherwise justify a variance from the Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent believes that \u201c[t]his petition involves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts that do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may adopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in place of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d  Post, at 1.  But that is in fact not distinct from the issue we addressed in Kimbrough.  To say that the judge who considers the 100:1 ratio excessive cannot apply a different ratio is to say that the Kimbrough-sanctioned district-court disagreement with the 100:1 ratio cannot honestly be given effect.  It is absurd to think that a sentence which is reasonable in light of the statutory sentencing factors, see 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a), becomes unreasonable if the sentencing judge chooses to specify his disagreement, and the degree of his disagreement, with the 100:1 ratio, which is the entire basis for his Guidelines departure.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent says that \u201cApprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough have given the lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively short period.\u201d  Post, at 3.  True enough\u2014and we should therefore promptly remove from the menu the Eighth Circuit\u2019s offering, a smuggled-in dish that is indigestible.  Finally, the dissent points out that other courts have followed the Eighth Circuit\u2019s course, see United States v. Russell, 537 F.\u00a03d 6, 11 (CA1 2008); United States v. Gunter, 527 F.\u00a03d 282, 286 (CA3 2008).  Both of those courts, like the Eighth Circuit, seized upon the language from Kimbrough quoted above in order to stand by the course they had adopted pre-Kimbrough\u2014and in the case of the First Circuit, despite this Court\u2019s having vacated and remanded, in light of Kimbrough, the prior First Circuit judgment which had established that course.  See Pho v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  If the error of those opinions is, as we think, evident, they demonstrate the need to clarify at once the holding of Kimbrough.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and set the case for oral argument.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas dissents.\n*\u00a0The Sentencing Commission has since reduced the crack-to-powder ratio.

Rather, the court held that given the documentation of contemporary racial discrimination in \"covered jurisdictions\", Congress acted rationally in extending the provision, rendering Section 5 constitutional.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Does Section 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") permit any \"political subunit\" of a \"covered state\" from seeking exemption from Section 5 of the VRA when it permits \"political subdivisions\" within \"covered states\" from seeking such exemptions?</p>\n<p>2) Was the 2006 extension of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act a valid exercise of congressional power when the <em>Congressional Record</em> indicated no persistent patter of \"covered states\" attempting to evade the enforcement of the VRA?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. Not answered. The Supreme Court held that the VRA permits all political subdivisions, including the district, to seek to bailout from the preclearance requirements of the VRA. With Chief Justice John G. Roberts writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, and in part by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court reasoned that the language of the VRA did not constrict the availability of a bailout for political subunits like Northwest Municipal. Moreover, the Court reasoned that considering that only 17 of 12,000 jurisdictions covered by the VRA had bailed out suggested that Congress had never intended for it to be so difficult to bailout.</p>\n<p>Justice Thomas wrote separately, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. He criticized the Court for not addressing the constitutionality of Section 5 of the VRA. He argued that he thought it did in fact exceed Congress' power to enforce the 15th Amendment, rendering it unconstitutional.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 25151, "name": "Gregory S.

The orders were subsequently affirmed by a New York federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p>Over ten years later, the Second Circuit vacated the orders, stating that state-law actions (\"Direct Actions\") against Travelers that alleged wrongdoing while it acted as Johns-Manville Corp.'s insurer were not barred by the 1986 order. The court held that the federal bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to prevent such lawsuits.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit err in holding that bankruptcy courts do not have the power to enter orders that extend beyond matters directly related to the execution of a debtor's estate?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that the Second Circuit erred in holding that federal bankruptcy courts lack jurisdiction to enter orders beyond matters directly related to the execution of a debtor's estate. With Justice David H. Souter writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court recognized that the unambiguous terms of the 1986 orders barred Direct Actions against Travelers and the orders' finality stood in the way of challenging their enforceability. It reasoned that the federal bankruptcy court's 1986 orders had become final on direct review 20 years previously, and thus the Second Circuit improperly ruled on an issue that was not reviewable.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented. He criticized the majority for improperly interpreting the meaning of the 1986 orders.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 17925, "name": "Barry R.

The case, brought by the federal government and the United States Enrichment Corporation, has been consolidated from two cases both alleging that Eurodif, a French corporation, imported LEU in violation of federal antidumping laws. Based on a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit holding that SWU contracts for the production of LEU are contracts for services rather than goods and are therefore immune from the antidumping laws, the U.S. Department of Commerce excluded all LEU entering the country from antidumping regulations if accompanied by a certificate that the uranium was imported under an SWU contract. The Court of International Trade sustained the Commerce Department decision.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit dismissed the case, saying that it was \"unripe\" for judicial review. The court held that the issues raised by the government only concerned the application of the Department's decision regarding future importation of LEU; and, therefore, the court did not have a specific factual context in which to review the claim.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Should 19 U.S.C. Section 1673, which calls for \"antidumping\" duties on foreign goods, but not services, that sell at less than fair value in the U.S., apply to imported low enriched uranium?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice David H. Souter, the Supreme Court held that the Commerce Department's view of imported low enriched uranium, as the sale of goods rather than services, was permissible. It reasoned that, since 19 U.S.C. Section 1673 did not specify whether it applied to the production of low enriched uranium, it was left to the reasonable interpretation of the Commerce Department to determine. Accordingly, the Court found the Commerce Department interpreted the statute reasonably.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 36722, "name": "Malcolm L.

When Negusie tried to come into the country, however, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) denied his application for asylum and withholding of removal. The INS based its decision on evidence that Negusie assisted in the persecution of prison inmates on the basis of a protected ground, specifically, the prisoners' Protestant religious beliefs. Negusie appealed his case to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), arguing that he did not voluntarily assist in the persecution but rather attempted to help the individuals who were being mistreated.</p>\n<p>The BIA gave little weight to Negusie's argument that he was trying to help the prisoners, instead focusing on his more prominent involvement in the persecution as an armed guard who oversaw and was complicit in the acts. After the BIA upheld the INS' denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal, Negusie filed a petition to have his case reviewed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Finding that the evidence from the BIA decision did not compel a conclusion that Negusie was uninvolved in the persecution of inmates, the Fifth Circuit denied his petition.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Can a foreign citizen who is denied asylum due to his involvement in the persecution of others on the basis of a protected ground argue that he was compelled to do so by his military superiors and, on several occasions, actually attempted to help those who were being persecuted?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not answered. The Supreme Court held that the BIA and Fifth Circuit erred when they evaluated Mr. Negusie's asylum petition because they presumed it mandatory that an alien's coercion to persecute was immaterial when determining whether the \"persecutor bar\" applies. With Justice Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice David H. Souter, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Court found that the BIA failed to exercise its discretion when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and therefore interpreted the INA from a mistaken legal premise. The Court ordered that the BIA interpret the ambiguous provisions of the INA and then review Mr. Negusie's case with respect to its interpretation.</p>\n<p>Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Alito, wrote a separate concurring opinion noting that he would not have agreed to remand Mr. Negusie's case had the majority prevented the BIA from reaching the same conclusion once again. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, concurred in part and dissented in part. He criticized the majority for failing to establish a standard for when the \"persecutor bar\" applies to an alien's asylum petition. Justice Clarence Thomas also dissented, arguing that the INA unambiguously precludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted voluntarily or was coerced.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 16723, "name": "Andrew J.

The couple subsequently divorced, and as part of the settlement Liv agreed to give up any interests she may have in the plans. However, William never submitted this portion of the settlement prior to his death in 2001, so the pension and retirement savings benefits were paid out to Liv. William's daughter, Keri, the executor of his estate, brought suit against Dupont to recover the benefits. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas granted summary judgment for the estate, awarding it the value of the benefits.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, explaining that because William had never submitted the portion of the settlement agreement denying the benefits to Liv, they were correctly paid out to her by Dupont.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's anti-alienation provision prevent the enforcement of a waiver recognized by federal common law which holds that a spouse's right to the other spouse's pension benefits is rendered void upon divorce?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. In a unanimous decision with Justice David Souter writing for the Court, the Supreme Court held that Liv's waiver of her former husband's pension benefits upon their divorce was not rendered void by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's anti-alienation provision. However, the Court held that Liv was appropriately granted the benefits of her ex-husband's estate because the plan administrator properly disregarded her waiver. It reasoned that the pension plan was clearly laid out and recognized Liv as the beneficiary. The plan had a mechanism in which Liv could have disclaimed her interest, but she did not.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 34700, "name": "Leondra R.

The district court dismissed the case for failing to state a claim. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It reasoned that actions brought by private parties under the FCA must be appealed within 30 days of judgment and not 60 days as when the United States is a party to the lawsuit. Here, the employees of the city of New York appealed 54 days after judgment and thus their appeal was untimely.</p>\n", "question": "<p>For an action filed under the False Claims Act, does the 30-day or 60-day time limit apply for filing an appeal when the United States is not a party in the lawsuit?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, it held that the 30-day limit applies for filing a claim under the False Claims Act when the United States is not a party to the lawsuit.

(CSX) under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA)in a Tennessee state court alleging that the railroad had negligently caused him to contract asbestosis. He sought pain and suffering damages for, among other things, his fear of developing lung cancer. Despite the objections of CSX, the trial court refused to provide a jury instruction as to the standard for awarding \"fear of cancer\" damages. Subsequently, the jury awarded Mr. Hensley $5 million in damages. On appeal to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, CSX argued that the trial court misapplied the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Ayers</em> where the Court established a standard for finding \"fear of cancer\" damages. The court of appeals rejected the argument and affirmed the trial court. In its petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, CSX argued that the Tennessee Court of Appeals misapplied the Court's decision in <em>Ayers</em> and that the jury should have been instructed that Mr. Hensley needed to prove that his fear of cancer was \"genuine and serious\" in order to collect damages.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did the Tennessee Court of Appeals misread and misapply the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Ayers</em> such that a jury instruction should have been provided as to the standard for finding \"fear of cancer\" damages when CSX requested it?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a per curiam opinion the Court reversed the Tennessee Court of Appeals, holding that a court must provide the standard for finding \"fear of cancer\" damages when requested by the defendant. The Court remanded Mr. Hensley's case to the Tennessee state courts for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens dissented. He argued that based on his reading of <em>Ayers</em>, the Court improperly attempted to play the role of error corrector, when that decision explicated that the jury should be provided discretion when making damages calculations.</p>\n", "advocates": null, "oral_argument_audio": null, "citation": {"volume": "556", "page": null, "year": "2009", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/20829"}, "decisions": [{"description": null, "votes": [{"member": {"ID": 15086, "name": "John G.

The officers had scanned the license of the car and found that it had a \"mandatory insurance suspension.\" Although the stop was solely predicated on the suspended license, the officers began to question the car's occupants, including Johnson, about gang activity in the area. Based on certain circumstantial evidence, such as Johnson's possession of a police scanner, the officers asked Johnson to exit the car so that they could question him further. Although Johnson was free to stay in the car, he voluntarily exited and a subsequent search of his person by the officers revealed a handgun and a small amount of marijuana. Based on evidence obtained during this search, Johnson was convicted in Arizona state court of (1) the unlawful possession of a weapon as a prohibited possessor and (2) possession of marijuana. Johnson appealed, arguing that the evidence recovered from the search should have been suppressed because the officers did not have probable cause to search him at the time of his arrest and therefore did so in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals of Arizona agreed with Johnson and reversed his conviction and sentence. The court found that the officers had no reason to believe that Johnson was involved in any criminal activity when he was searched. The officers requested that Johnson step out of the car to discuss gang activity, not because the officers feared that their safety was threatened, thus it was part of a consensual encounter between the officers and Johnson. Therefore, the court said, the officers' subsequent search of Johnson was illegal and unconstitutional.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Do officers violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures when, after making a routine traffic stop, they search an individual who is consensually conversing with those officers?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed the Arizona Court of Appeals. It held that Mr. Johnson's encounter with police officers was not consensual and therefore did not violate his Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. The Court reasoned that lawful traffic stops entail the \"temporary seizure of driver and passengers\" that continues for the duration of the stop. Officer inquiries into matters unrelated to the stop do not transform the event into a \"consensual\" encounter whereby the driver or passenger is free to go as he or she pleases. Therefore, the police officers who frisked Mr. Johnson were not constitutionally required to depart the scene without first ensuring that he was not armed and dangerous, so long as they reasonably suspected he was armed and dangerous.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 32424, "name": "Joseph L.

JOHNSON\ncertiorari to the court of appeals of arizona\nNo. 07\u20131122.\u2003Argued December 9, 2008\u2014Decided January 26, 2009\nIn Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, this Court held that a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures if two conditions are met.  First, the investigatory stop (temporary detention) must be lawful, a requirement met in an on-the-street encounter when a police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a crime.  Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk (patdown for weapons), the officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.  For the duration of a traffic stop, the Court recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes \u201ceveryone in the vehicle,\u201d the driver and all passengers.  Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249, 255.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While patrolling near a Tucson neighborhood associated with the Crips gang, police officers serving on Arizona\u2019s gang task force stopped an automobile for a vehicular infraction warranting a citation.  At the time of the stop, the officers had no reason to suspect the car\u2019s occupants of criminal activity.  Officer Trevizo attended to respondent Johnson, the back-seat passenger, whose behavior and clothing caused Trevizo to question him.  After learning that Johnson was from a town with a Crips gang and had been in prison, Trevizo asked him get out of the car in order to question him further, out of the hearing of the front-seat passenger, about his gang affiliation.  Because she suspected that he was armed, she patted him down for safety when he exited the car.  During the patdown, she felt the butt of a gun.  At that point, Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo handcuffed him.  Johnson was charged with, inter alia, possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that the stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.  Johnson was convicted.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.  While recognizing that Johnson was lawfully seized, the court found that, prior to the frisk, the detention had evolved into a consensual conversation about his gang affiliation.  Trevizo, the court therefore concluded, had no right to pat Johnson down even if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dangerous.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.\nHeld:\u00a0Officer Trevizo\u2019s patdown of Johnson did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.  Pp.\u00a05\u20139.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) Terry established that, in an investigatory stop based on reasonably grounded suspicion of criminal activity, the police must be positioned to act instantly if they have reasonable cause to suspect that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous.  392 U. S., at 24.  Because a limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to protect both the officer and the public, a patdown is constitutional.  Id., at 23\u201324, 27, 30\u201331.  Traffic stops, which \u201cresemble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in Terry,\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439, n. 29, are \u201cespecially fraught with danger to police officers,\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1047, who may minimize the risk of harm by exercising \u201c\u00a0\u2018unquestioned command of the situation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414.  Three decisions cumulatively portray Terry\u2019s application in a traffic-stop setting.  In Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (per curiam), the Court held that \u201conce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment,\u201d id., at 111, n.\u00a06, because the government\u2019s \u201clegitimate and weighty\u201d interest in officer safety outweighs the \u201cde minimis\u201d additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle, id., at 110\u2013111.  Citing Terry, the Court further held that a driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver might be armed and dangerous.  434 U. S., at 112.  Wilson, 519 U. S., at 413, held that the Mimms rule applies to passengers as well as drivers, based on \u201cthe same weighty interest in officer safety.\u201d  Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 263, held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is, \u201cfrom the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the road.\u201d  A passenger\u2019s motivation to use violence during the stop to prevent apprehension for a crime more grave than a traffic violation is just as great as that of the driver.  519 U. S., at 414.  And as \u201cthe passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle,\u201d id., at 413\u2013414, \u201cthe additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal,\u201d id., at 415.  Pp.\u00a05\u20137.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger, but concluded that once Officer Trevizo began questioning him on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.  The court portrayed the interrogation as consensual, and, Johnson emphasizes, Trevizo testified that Johnson could have refused to exit the vehicle and to submit to the patdown.  But Trevizo also testified that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her questions or otherwise cooperate with her.  A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop.  Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave.  An officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the stop\u2019s duration.  See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 100\u2013101.  A reasonable passenger would understand that during the time a car is lawfully stopped, he or she is not free to terminate the encounter with the police and move about at will.  Nothing occurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free \u201cto depart without police permission.\u201d  Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 257.  Trevizo was not required by the Fourth Amendment to give Johnson an opportunity to depart without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.  Pp.\u00a07\u20139.\n217 Ariz. 58, 170 P.\u00a03d 667, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court."}, {"id": 1792, "title": "Opinion of the Court", "author": null, "type": {"value": "majority", "label": "Opinion of the Court"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962789, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/323/opinion.html", "judge_full_name": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "judge_last_name": "Ginsburg", "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1792", "justia_text": "ARIZONA, PETITIONER v. LEMON MONTREA\nJOHNSON\non writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona, division two\n[January 26, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case concerns the authority of police officers to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d a passenger in a motor vehicle temporarily seized upon police detection of a traffic infraction.  In a pathmarking decision, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), the Court considered whether an investigatory stop (temporary detention) and frisk (patdown for weapons) may be conducted without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  The Court upheld \u201cstop and frisk\u201d as constitutionally permissible if two conditions are met.  First, the investigatory stop must be lawful.  That requirement is met in an on-the-street encounter, Terry determined, when the police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense.  Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the duration of a traffic stop, we recently confirmed, a police officer effectively seizes \u201ceveryone in the vehicle,\u201d the driver and all passengers.  Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249, 255 (2007).  Accordingly, we hold that, in a traffic-stop setting, the first Terry condition\u2014a lawful investigatory stop\u2014is met whenever it is lawful for police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into a vehicular violation.  The police need not have, in addition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity.  To justify a patdown of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 19, 2002, Officer Maria Trevizo and Detectives Machado and Gittings, all members of Arizona\u2019s gang task force, were on patrol in Tucson near a neighborhood associated with the Crips gang.  At approximately 9 p.m., the officers pulled over an automobile after a license plate check revealed that the vehicle\u2019s registration had been suspended for an insurance-related violation.  Under Arizona law, the violation for which the vehicle was stopped constituted a civil infraction warranting a citation.  At the time of the stop, the vehicle had three occupants\u2014the driver, a front-seat passenger, and a passenger in the back seat, Lemon Montrea Johnson, the respondent here.  In making the stop the officers had no reason to suspect anyone in the vehicle of criminal activity.  See App. 29\u201330.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The three officers left their patrol car and approached the stopped vehicle.  Machado instructed all of the occupants to keep their hands visible.  Id., at 14.  He asked whether there were any weapons in the vehicle; all responded no.  Id., at 15.  Machado then directed the driver to get out of the car.  Gittings dealt with the front-seat passenger, who stayed in the vehicle throughout the stop.  See id., at 31.  While Machado was getting the driver\u2019s license and information about the vehicle\u2019s registra-\ntion and insurance, see id., at 42\u201343, Trevizo attended to\nJohnson.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trevizo noticed that, as the police approached, Johnson looked back and kept his eyes on the officers.  Id., at 12.  When she drew near, she observed that Johnson was wearing clothing, including a blue bandana, that she considered consistent with Crips membership.  Id., at 17.  She also noticed a scanner in Johnson\u2019s jacket pocket, which \u201cstruck [her] as highly unusual and cause [for] concern,\u201d  because  \u201cmost people\u201d would not carry around a scanner that way \u201cunless they\u2019re going to be involved in some kind of criminal activity or [are] going to try to evade the police by listening to the scanner.\u201d  Id., at 16.  In response to Trevizo\u2019s questions, Johnson provided his name and date of birth but said he had no identification with him.  He volunteered that he was from Eloy, Arizona, a place Trevizo knew was home to a Crips gang.  Johnson further told Trevizo that he had served time in prison for burglary and had been out for about a year.  217 Ariz. 58, 60, 170 P.\u00a03d 667, 669 (App. 2007).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trevizo wanted to question Johnson away from the front-seat passenger to gain \u201cintelligence about the gang [Johnson] might be in.\u201d  App. 19.  For that reason, she asked him to get out of the car.  Ibid.  Johnson complied.  Based on Trevizo\u2019s observations and Johnson\u2019s answers to her questions while he was still seated in the car, Trevizo suspected that \u201che might have a weapon on him.\u201d  Id., at 20.  When he exited the vehicle, she therefore \u201cpatted him down for officer safety.\u201d  Ibid.  During the patdown, Trevizo felt the butt of a gun near Johnson\u2019s waist.  217 Ariz., at 60, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 669.  At that point Johnson began to struggle, and Trevizo placed him in handcuffs.  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson was charged in state court with, inter alia, possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor.  He moved to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an unlawful search.  The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the stop was lawful and that Trevizo had cause to suspect Johnson was armed and dangerous.  See App. 74\u201378.  A jury convicted Johnson of the gun-possession charge.  See 217 Ariz., at 60\u201361, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 669\u2013670.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed Johnson\u2019s conviction.  Id., at 59, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 668.  Recognizing that \u201cJohnson was [lawfully] seized when the officers stopped the car,\u201d id., at 62, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 671, the court nevertheless concluded that prior to the frisk the detention had \u201cevolved into a separate, consensual encounter stemming from an unrelated investigation by Trevizo of Johnson\u2019s possible gang affiliation,\u201d id., at 64, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 673.  Absent \u201creason to believe Johnson was involved in criminal activity,\u201d the Arizona appeals court held, Trevizo \u201chad no right to pat him down for weapons, even if she had reason to suspect he was armed and dangerous.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Espinosa dissented.  He found it \u201chighly unrealistic to conclude that merely because [Trevizo] was courteous and Johnson cooperative, the ongoing and virtually simultaneous chain of events [had] somehow \u2018evolved into a consensual encounter\u2019 in the few short moments involved.\u201d  Id., at 66, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 675.  Throughout the episode, he stressed, Johnson remained \u201cseized as part of [a] valid traffic stop.\u201d  Ibid.  Further, he maintained, Trevizo \u201chad a reasonable basis to consider [Johnson] dangerous,\u201d id., at 67, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 676, and could therefore ensure her own safety and that of others at the scene by patting down Johnson for weapons.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.  No. CR\u201307\u20130290\u2013PR, 2007 Ariz. LEXIS 154 (Nov. 29, 2007).  We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals.\nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin our consideration of the constitutionality of Officer Trevizo\u2019s patdown of Johnson by looking back to the Court\u2019s leading decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968).  Terry involved a stop for interrogation of men whose conduct had attracted the attention of a patrolling police officer.  The officer\u2019s observation led him reasonably to suspect that the men were casing a jewelry shop in preparation for a robbery.  He conducted a patdown, which disclosed weapons concealed in the men\u2019s overcoat pockets.  This Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 determinations that the interrogation was warranted and the patdown, permissible.  See id., at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terry established the legitimacy of an investigatory stop \u201cin situations where [the police] may lack probable cause for an arrest.\u201d Id., at 24.  When the stop is justified by suspicion (reasonably grounded, but short of probable cause) that criminal activity is afoot, the Court explained, the police officer must be positioned to act instantly on reasonable suspicion that the persons temporarily detained are armed and dangerous.  Ibid.  Recognizing that a limited search of outer clothing for weapons serves to protect both the officer and the public, the Court held the patdown reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Id., at 23\u201324, 27, 30\u201331.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c[M]ost traffic stops,\u201d this Court has observed, \u201cresemble, in duration and atmosphere, the kind of brief detention authorized in Terry.\u201d  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439, n. 29 (1984).  Furthermore, the Court has recognized that traffic stops are \u201cespecially fraught with danger to police officers.\u201d  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1047 (1983).  \u201c\u00a0\u2018The risk of harm to both the police and the occupants [of a stopped vehicle] is minimized,\u2019\u00a0\u201d we have stressed, \u201c\u00a0\u2018if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414 (1997) (quoting Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 702\u2013703 (1981)); see Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258.  Three decisions cumulatively portray Terry\u2019s application in a traffic-stop setting: Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106 (1977) (per curiam); Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408 (1997); and Brendlin v. California, 551 U. S. 249 (2007).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Mimms, the Court held that \u201conce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d 434 U. S., at 111, n.\u00a06.  The government\u2019s \u201clegitimate and weighty\u201d interest in officer safety, the Court said, outweighs the \u201cde minimis\u201d additional intrusion of requiring a driver, already lawfully stopped, to exit the vehicle. Id., at 110\u2013111.  Citing Terry as controlling, the Court further held that a driver, once outside the stopped vehicle, may be patted down for weapons if the officer reasonably concludes that the driver \u201cmight be armed and presently dangerous.\u201d  434 U. S., at 112.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wilson held that the Mimms rule applied to passengers as well as to drivers.  Specifically, the Court instructed that \u201can officer making a traffic stop may order passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop.\u201d 519 U. S., at 415. \u201c[T]he same weighty interest in officer safety,\u201d the Court observed, \u201cis present regardless of whether the occupant of the stopped car is a driver or passenger.\u201d  Id., at 413.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true, the Court acknowledged, that in a lawful traffic stop, \u201c[t]here is probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a minor vehicular offense,\u201d but \u201cthere is no such reason to stop or detain the passengers.\u201d Ibid.  On the other hand, the Court emphasized, the risk of a violent encounter in a traffic-stop setting \u201cstems not from the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a speeding violation, but from the fact that evidence of a more serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.\u201d Id., at 414.  \u201c[T]he motivation of a passenger to employ violence to prevent apprehension of such a crime,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cis every bit as great as that of the driver.\u201d Ibid.  Moreover, the Court noted, \u201cas a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle,\u201d id., at 413\u2013414, so \u201cthe additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal,\u201d id., at 415.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Completing the picture, Brendlin held that a passenger is seized, just as the driver is, \u201cfrom the moment [a car stopped by the police comes] to a halt on the side of the road.\u201d  551 U. S., at 263.  A passenger therefore has standing to challenge a stop\u2019s constitutionality.  Id., at 256\u2013259.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Wilson, but before Brendlin, the Court had stated, in dictum, that officers who conduct \u201croutine traffic stop[s]\u201d may \u201cperform a \u2018patdown\u2019 of a driver and any passengers upon reasonable suspicion that they may be armed and dangerous.\u201d  Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 117\u2013118 (1998).  That forecast, we now confirm, accurately captures the combined thrust of the Court\u2019s decisions in Mimms, Wilson, and Brendlin.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arizona Court of Appeals recognized that, initially, Johnson was lawfully detained incident to the legitimate stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger.  See 217 Ariz., at 64, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 673.  But, that court concluded, once Officer Trevizo undertook to question Johnson on a matter unrelated to the traffic stop, i.e., Johnson\u2019s gang affiliation, patdown authority ceased to exist, absent reasonable suspicion that Johnson had engaged, or was about to engage, in criminal activity.  See id., at 65, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 674.  In support of the Arizona court\u2019s portrayal of Trevizo\u2019s interrogation of Johnson as \u201cconsensual,\u201d Johnson emphasizes Trevizo\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing.  Responding to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, Trevizo affirmed her belief that Johnson could have \u201crefused to get out of the car\u201d and \u201cto turn around for the pat down.\u201d  App. 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not clear why the prosecutor, in opposing the suppression motion, sought to portray the episode as consensual.  Cf. Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 (1991) (holding that police officers\u2019 search of a bus passenger\u2019s luggage can be based on consent).  In any event, Trevizo also testified that she never advised Johnson he did not have to answer her questions or otherwise cooperate with her.  See App. 45.  And during cross-examination, Trevizo did not disagree when defense counsel asked \u201cin fact you weren\u2019t seeking [Johnson\u2019s] permission \u2026 ?\u201d Id., at 36.  As the dissenting judge observed, \u201cconsensual\u201d is an \u201cunrealistic\u201d characterization of the Trevizo-Johnson interaction.  \u201c[T]he encounter \u2026 took place within minutes of the stop\u201d; the patdown followed \u201cwithin mere moments\u201d of Johnson\u2019s exit from the vehicle; beyond genuine debate, the point at which Johnson could have felt free to leave had not yet occurred.  See 217 Ariz., at 66, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 675.[Footnote 1]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A lawful roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation.  The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop.  Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave.  See Brendlin, 551 U. S., at 258.  An officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.  See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 100\u2013101 (2005).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, as stated in Brendlin, a traffic stop of a car communicates to a reasonable passenger that he or she is not free to terminate the encounter with the police and move about at will.  See 551 U. S., at 257.  Nothing occurred in this case that would have conveyed to Johnson that, prior to the frisk, the traffic stop had ended or that he was otherwise free \u201cto depart without police permission.\u201d  Ibid.  Officer Trevizo surely was not constitutionally required to give Johnson an opportunity to depart the scene after he exited the vehicle without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.[Footnote 2]\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0The Court of Appeals majority did not assert that Johnson reasonably could have felt free to leave.  Instead, the court said \u201ca reasonable person in Johnson\u2019s position would have felt free to remain in the vehicle.\u201d  217 Ariz. 58, 64, 170 P.\u00a03d 667, 673 (2007).  That position, however, appears at odds with our decision in Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408 (1997).  See supra, at 6\u20137.\n\u00a0The Arizona Court of Appeals assumed, \u201cwithout deciding, that Trevizo had reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous.\u201d  217 Ariz., at 64, 170 P.\u00a03d, at 673.  We do not foreclose the appeals court\u2019s consideration of that issue on remand."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/323/"}, {"ID": 55575, "name": "Hawaii v.

The OHA was established to manage the proceeds from lands ceded by the Kingdom of Hawaii following its overthrow by the United States. The lands were marked to provide for the benefit of native Hawaiians. The OHA argued that \"any transfer of ceded lands by the State to third parties would amount to a breach of trust\" and would be without consideration of the claims of native Hawaiians to those lands. However, the trial court held that the State did have the power to transfer the lands. The OHA appealed.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Hawaii overruled the trial court's decision and remanded the case with instructions to issue an injunction to prevent the transfer of ceded lands from the public trust. In its reasoning, it cited <em>Ahuna</em> to illustrate that the State as trustee of these lands was under an obligation to administer the trust 'solely in the interest of the beneficiary' (native Hawaiians). Further, it gave great weight to the Apology Resolution passed by the United States Congress in 1993 to mark the 100th Anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This resolution stated that \"native Hawaiians (1) 'never directly relinquished their claims to\u2026 their national lands to the United States,' and (2) 'are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory.'\" Therefore, the court held, it was the responsibility of the State of Hawaii to preserve the ceded lands in the public trust, at least until such land claims were resolved.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the symbolic Apology Resolution restrict the State of Hawaii's sovereign authority to transfer publicly held land for private development, at least until claims over such land are resolved?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. A unanimous Supreme Court held that the Apology Resolution did not restrict Hawaii's sovereign authority to transfer publicly held land for private development.

Because Jimenez had a prior felony conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, he was sentenced to 43 years in prison. Jimenez appealed and, in 1996, a state appeals court dismissed Jimenez's petition when a court-appointed lawyer stated that Jimenez had no grounds for appeal. Six years later the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals allowed leave for Jimenez to renew his appeal based on his lawyer's incompetence, however the court affirmed his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Jimenez filed a habeas corpus petition in a Texas federal court arguing that he had not received adequate legal assistance during his proceedings in the state courts. The district judge dismissed the claim, holding that the one-year statute of limitations, which began running on the date of conviction, had expired. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit also denied Jimenez's appeal. Jimenez, in his petition for certiorari, argued that the one-year statute of limitations should actually have begun in 2005, after his final appeal was denied in state court, rather than in 1995 when he was convicted.</p>\n", "question": "<p>When a criminal defendant is unable to obtain timely direct review of his case in state court, should the one-year statute of limitations for appeals begin to run at the date of conviction, as federal law prescribes, or after the delayed direct review is completed?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>In a unanimous opinion with Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the Court, the Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. It held that when a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal and he does so, the conviction is not final. Therefore, the statute of limitations begins to run only after the out-of-time direct appeal is final. The Court remanded Mr. Jimenez's case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 42731, "name": "Thomas C.

Ms. Williams claimed that her husband had been convinced by Philip Morris' advertisements and representations that smoking did not pose any significant health risks and had refused to quit smoking despite his family's pleas. She alleged that Philip Morris' fraud and negligence in this regard had caused her husband's death.</p>\n<p>At trial, a jury found in favor of Ms. Williams and awarded her $79.5 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $32 million. On appeal, Philip Morris argued that the trial court had committed an error when it failed to give a proposed jury instruction stating, in part, that the jury should not \"punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.\" The case eventually wound up before the Oregon Supreme Court (\"OSC\"), which ruled that the proposed jury instruction incorrectly stated the federal requirements of due process of law, and the trial court was therefore correct to exclude it. The OSC found it unnecessary to rule, at that time, on whether the jury instruction was flawed for its description of state-law requirements. Philip Morris sought and was granted certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court reversed the OSC, stating that due process did not necessarily require exclusion of the instruction, and remanded the case so that the OSC could apply the correct standard.</p>\n<p>On remand, the OSC stated that the U.S. Supreme Court's new constitutional standard was only triggered \"upon request,\" which obligated it to determine whether Philip Morris's request was valid under state law. The OSC held that the proposed instruction misstated Oregon's statutory punitive damages criteria and therefore was not \"clear and correct in all respects,\" as it must be to be considered error. The U.S. Supreme Court, which will now hear the case for the second time after granting Philip Morris' certiorari petition, must determine whether the OSC is permitted to insert these state law issues at such a late stage in the game.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Can a state court, after the U.S. Supreme Court has remanded a case back to it with instructions to apply the correct constitutional standard, raise a state-law procedural bar for the first time?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 42002, "name": "Stephen M.

After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the American company breached its contract with Iran and sold the equipment elsewhere. Iran requested arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and received $2.8 million in damages for breach of contract. Iran then reduced the award to a judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.</p>\n<p>Dariush Elahi, brought a wrongful death claim against the Iranian government alleging that Iranian agents had assassinated his brother in Paris in 1990. Elahi was awarded over $300 million in damages by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He attempted to satisfy this judgment in part by attaching the damages Iran had recovered from the previous contract dispute. Iran argued that the previous recovery was immune from attachment. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California held that Iran had waived its immunity from attachment by submitting to the jurisdiction of the ICC and the district court in its prior contract dispute.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the district court's ruling but on different grounds. The court held that Elahi could attach the Iranian judgment under Section 201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which allows creditors such as Elahi to attach \"the blocked assets of [a] terrorist party.\" Eschewing the jurisdiction argument relied on by the district court, the Ninth Circuit characterized Iran as a \"terrorist party\" and held that the contract judgment was a \"blocked asset\" subject to attachment.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 allow a judgment creditor in a wrongful death action against the Iranian government to attach damages recovered by Iran in an unrelated contract dispute as the \"blocked assets of [a] terrorist party?\"</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not answered. With Justice Stephen G. Breyer writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court held that the assets in question in Mr. Elahi's case were not \"blocked\" under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 at the time of the Ninth Circuit's decision and therefore could not be attached to satisfy his judgment against Iran. The Court then declined to determine whether a 2005 Executive Order issued by the President blocked the assets, holding that Mr. Elahi had waived his rights to attach. The Court reasoned that when Mr. Elahi accepted payment under a federal statute that offered compensation for those \"holding terrorism related judgments against Iran\", he relinquished his right to attach those assets.</p>\n<p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concurred in part and dissented in part, and was joined by Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He agreed that the assets in question were not \"blocked\" at the time of the Ninth Circuit's decision. However, he disagreed that Mr. Elahi had waived his right to attach those assets. He reasoned that the majority departed from the \"plain meaning\" and \"purpose\" of the federal statute that awarded compensation to Mr. Elahi when it inhibited his ability to collect the award granted him against Iran for the murder of his brother.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 20529, "name": "David J.

After he was convicted of second-degree murder and two attempted second-degree murder charges in a jury trial, Sarausad filed a petition for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The district court granted Sarausad's motion, holding that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that certain confusing jury instructions related to accomplice liability unconstitutionally relieved the state of its burden of proof.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's ruling on the insufficiency of evidence claim but affirmed on the jury instructions claim. The court stated that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support a conviction under <em>Jackson v. Virginia</em>. However, the jury instructions were ambiguous on the question of whether Sarausad could be convicted of murder and attempted murder on a theory of accomplice liability without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew an accomplice intended to commit a murder. According to the Ninth Circuit, there was a reasonable chance the jury misapplied these instructions.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) In reviewing a due process challenge to a jury instruction, must federal courts accept state court findings that instructions were correct?</p>\n<p>2) Did the U.S. Court of Appeals err in affirming federal habeas corpus relief when it found a \"reasonable likelihood\" that the jury misapplied the jury instruction in Mr. Sarausad's case and thereby relieved the state of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not necessarily and yes. In a 6-3 decision with Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Court held that a federal court may reject state court conclusions with respect to the appropriateness of a state court jury instruction, so long as the instructions were \"not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\" Here, the standard was not met and the Ninth Circuit should have accepted the conclusions of the state courts. Further, the Court held that the Ninth Circuit erred in finding Mr. Sarausad's jury instructions so ambiguous that his constitutional rights were violated and therefore he was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter dissented and was joined by Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Souter criticized the majority opinion for relying on the fact that the jury instructions in Mr. Sarausad's case incorporated part of a state statute as evidence enough that the instructions were unambiguous. Further, he noted that the jury asked three times for clarification in the instructions. Therefore, Justice Souter argued, it was likely the jury did not grasp what it needed to find in order to convict Mr. Sarausad for accomplice liability.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 44202, "name": "William B.

In 1994, Randy Hayes pled guilty in West Virginia to a misdemeanor battery offense after striking his wife. Ten years later, in 2004, police responded to a domestic violence call at Hayes' home. While conducting a search of the premises the police uncovered a Winchester rifle. They arrested Hayes for possessing a firearm after being convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence based on the 1994 plea. Hayes argued that his prior conviction for misdemeanor battery did not constitute a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of violence under the statute. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected this argument and Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea to reserve his claim for appeal.</p>\n<p>Hayes' strategy was a success, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court. The court held that conviction of a misdemeanor battery does not qualify as a crime of domestic violence, noting that the legislative intent and plain meaning of the statute indicated that the original offense must involve a \"domestic\" relationship between the victim and offender. Finding this requirement unfulfilled in the case, the Fourth Circuit reversed Hayes' conviction.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, does a conviction for misdemeanor battery constitute a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" when the victim was the offender's wife and the predicate offense statute did not designate a \"domestic relationship\" between aggressor and victim as an element of the crime?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court reversed the Fourth Circuit holding that the predicate offense statute need not include the existence of a \"domestic relationship\" as an element of the crime in order to qualify as a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as specified by the Gun Control Act of 1968. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the majority and joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice David H. Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, and joined in part by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court reasoned that the language of the Gun Control Act suggested that the predicate offense statute need only include \"the use of force\" as an element of the crime and need not include a \"domestic relationship\" as an additional element.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts dissented and was joined by Justice Antonin G. Scalia. He criticized the majority opinion's use of grammatical rules by which it reached an unsound conclusion. He argued that the rule of lenity should apply as the Gun Control Act was ambiguous and therefore should be interpreted in the defendant's favor.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 37291, "name": "Nicole A.

Ms. Redding subsequently filed suit against the school district and the school officials responsible for the search in the District Court for the District of Arizona. She alleged her Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. On the initial appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. However, on rehearing before the entire court, the court of appeals held that Ms. Redding's Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure was violated. It reasoned that the strip search was not justified nor was the scope of intrusion reasonably related to the circumstances.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Does the Fourth Amendment prohibit school officials from strip searching students suspected of possessing drugs in violation of school policy?</p>\n<p>2) Are school officials individually liable for damages in a lawsuit filed under 42 U.S.C Section 1983?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Sometimes, fact dependent. No. The Supreme Court held that Savanna's Fourth Amendment rights were violated when school officials searched her underwear for non-prescription painkillers. With David H. Souter writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, and in part by Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court reiterated that, based on a reasonable suspicion, search measures used by school officials to root out contraband must be \"reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.\" Here, school officials did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant extending the search of Savanna to her underwear. The Court also held that the implicated school administrators were not personally liable because \"clearly established law [did] not show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\" It reasoned that lower court decisions were disparate enough to have warranted doubt about the scope of a student's Fourth Amendment right.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part, and was joined by Justice Ginsburg. He agreed that the strip search was unconstitutional, but disagreed that the school administrators retained immunity. He stated that \"[i]t does not require a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude search of a 13-year old child is an invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude.\" Justice Ginsburg also wrote a separate concurring opinion, largely agreeing with Justice Stevens point of dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part. He agreed with the majority that the school administrators were qualifiedly immune to prosecution. However, he argued that the judiciary should not meddle with decisions school administrators make that are in the interest of keeping their schools safe.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 36841, "name": "Matthew W.

Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), a sentencing enhancement statute. They appealed arguing that Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) only applies to the intentional discharge of a firearm.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) does not have an intent requirement. It explained, \"The mere discharge of a firearm during any crime of violence\u2026 even accidental, is subject to the sentencing enhancement\", requiring ten additional years imprisonment.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) require proof that the discharge of a firearm was intentional?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) does not require proof of intent to discharge a firearm in order enhance a sentence. With Chief Justice John G. Roberts writing for the majority and joined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that the grammatical structure of the statute demonstrates that there is no intent requirement in order to enhance the convicted person's sentence.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens dissented. He argued that criminal liability should not attach in cases where an accident causes no harm, as in Mr. Dean's case. Justice Stephen G. Breyer also dissented. He argued that 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) was sufficiently ambiguous that it should be viewed in favor of Mr. Dean, such that the statute provides \"fair warning\" to criminal behavior.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 41286, "name": "Scott J.

Although the park already housed a monument to the Ten Commandments, the mayor denied Summum's request because the monument did not \"directly relate to the history of Pleasant Grove.\" Summum filed suit against the city in federal court citing, among other things, a violation of its First Amendment free speech rights. The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah denied Summum's request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court and granted Summum's injunction request. The Tenth Circuit held that the park was in fact a \"public\" forum, not a non-public forum as the district court had held. Furthermore, Summum demonstrated that it would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were to be denied, and the interests of the city did not outweigh this potential harm. The injunction, according to the court, was also not against the public interest.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does a city's refusal to place a religious organization's monument in a public park violate that organization's First Amendment free speech rights when the park already contains a monument from a different religious group?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit holding that the placement of a monument in a public park is a form of government speech and therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. With Justice Samuel A. Alito writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court reasoned that since Pleasant Grove City had retained final authority over which monuments were displayed, the monuments represented an expression of the city's viewpoints and thus government speech.</p>\n<p>Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg, wrote a separate concurring opinion that largely embraced the majority's reasoning. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, also wrote a separate concurring opinion. Agreeing with the Court's reasoning, he also noted that there were likely no violations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment on the part of Pleasant Grove City. He argued that displays of the Ten Commandments had been construed by the Court as \"having an undeniable historical meaning\" and thus did not attempt to establish a religion. Justice Breyer also wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he noted that \"government speech\" should be considered a rule of thumb and not a rigid category. He stated that sometimes the Court should ask \"whether a government's actions burdens speech disproportionately in light of the action's tendency to further a legitimate government objective.\" Justice Souter also wrote separately, concurring in the judgment, but warning that public monuments should not be considered government speech categorically.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 33043, "name": "Jay Alan Sekulow", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/jay_alan_sekulow", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Sekulow", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "jay_alan_sekulow"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioners", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19771"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 21060, "name": "Daryl Joseffer", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/daryl_joseffer", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Joseffer", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "daryl_joseffer"}, "advocate_description": "Deputy Solicitor General, Department of Justice, argued the cause for the United States, as amicus curiae, supporting the petitioners", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19772"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 37954, "name": "Pamela Harris", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/pamela_harris", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Harris", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "pamela_harris"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the respondent", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19773"}], "oral_argument_audio": [{"id": 21703, "title": "Oral Argument - November 12, 2008", "public_note": null, "unavailable": null, "display_title": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_media/oral_argument_audio/21703"}], "citation": {"volume": "555", "page": null, "year": "2009", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_citation/case_citation/20817"}, "decisions": [{"description": null, "votes": [{"member": {"ID": 15086, "name": "John G.

Sanders also claimed that the explosion had damaged his right eye. However subsequent examinations by Veterans' Affairs (\"VA\") optometrists suggested that the cause of the condition was difficult to determine and was likely due to an infection. When Sanders appeared before the Board of Veterans' Appeals, arguing that the injury was service related and seeking cost-free treatment, the Board denied his claim, finding that the injury was not service related. On appeal to the Veterans Court, Mr. Sanders argued that the VA failed to provide notice as to who was responsible for obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim, as required by the notice provision of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (\"VCAA\"). The Veterans Court affirmed the Board, basing its decision on the fact that Sanders did not suffer any \"specific prejudice\" due to the VA's failure to notify.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court, finding that the VCAA does not require any showing of prejudice. Any failure to notify as required by the Act creates a presumption of prejudice that need not be alleged or proved by the veteran seeking medical assistance.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit err in presuming a prejudicial error when the VA fails to give notice to claimant as to who is responsible for obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's framework for evaluating VA notice errors, conflicted with established law that the Veterans Court \"take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\". With Justice Stephen G. Breyer writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that the Federal Circuit's framework was too complex, rigid, and its presumption of prejudicial error imposed an unreasonable burden upon the VA. Rather, the Court stated the proper framework for the Veterans Court to apply is the \"harmless-error\" rule ordinarily applied in civil cases.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter dissented and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He disagreed that a veteran claimant bore the burden of persuasion when mounting a claim against the VA. He reasoned prior practice indicated congressional favoritism of veterans and that statutory doubt should be resolved in the veteran's favor. Moreover, he disagreed with the majority in its finding that the Federal Circuit's framework was \"complex\" and \"rigid,\" rather viewing it as \"workable.\"</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 22857, "name": "Eric D.

Ms. Levine had intravenously injected Phenergan, a drug made by Wyeth and used to prevent allergies and motion sickness, into her arm, and complications arising from the injection eventually led to the amputation of her arm. Ms. Levine brought this claim asserting that Wyeth had failed to include a warning label describing the possible arterial injuries that could occur from negligent injection of the drug. Wyeth argued that because their warning label had been deemed acceptable by the FDA, a federal agency, any Vermont state regulations making the label insufficient were preempted by the federal approval. The Superior Court of Vermont found in favor of Ms. Levine and denied Wyeth's motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Vermont affirmed this ruling on appeal, holding that the FDA requirements merely provide a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation. Therefore, states are free to create more stringent labeling requirements than federal law provides.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does federal law preempt state law in a personal injury action against a drug manufacturer for failing to include an appropriate warning label where the drug in question met the labeling requirements of the Food and Drug Administration?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court affirmed the Supreme Court of Vermont holding that federal law did not preempt Ms. Levine's state-law claim that Wyeth's labeling of Phenergan failed to warn of the dangers of its intravenous administration. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice David H. Souter, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Court first rejected Wyeth's argument that by unilaterally changing its labeling of Phenergan, it would have violated federal labeling regulations. Rather, the Court asserted that the manufacturer bears ultimate responsibility for the content of its labels at all times. The Court then rejected Wyeth's argument that requiring it to comply with the state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting the FDA with drug labeling decisions. Rather, the Court reasoned that Congress did not intend to preempt state-law failure to warn actions when it created the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>\n<p>Justice Breyer wrote a separate concurring opinion noting that the FDA may create regulations that preempt state law tort claims, but such a regulation was not at issue in Ms. Levine's case. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately, concurring only in the judgment. He criticized the majority opinion for implicitly endorsing a \"far-reaching implied pre-emption doctrine\" where the Court invalidates state laws based on perceived conflicts with federal statutes by extrapolating from evidence not found in the text of the statute itself. Justice Samuel A. Alito dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Antonin G. Scalia. He disagreed with the Court's holding that a jury, rather than the FDA is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs. He argued this is incompatible with the Court's precedent in <em>Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.</em>, which established the principles of conflict preemption.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 42213, "name": "Seth P.

DIANA LEVINE\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nvermont\n[March 4, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that the fact that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the label for petitioner Wyeth\u2019s drug Phenergan does not pre-empt the state-law judgment before the Court.  That judgment was based on a jury finding that the label did not adequately warn of the risk involved in administering Phenergan through the IV-push injection method.  Under federal law, without prior approval from the FDA, Wyeth could have \u201cadd[ed] or strengthen[ed]\u201d information on its label about \u201ca contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A) (2008), or \u201cabout dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u201d \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to \u201creflect newly acquired information,\u201d including \u201cnew analyses of previously submitted data,\u201d about the dangers of IV-push administration of Phenergan, 73 Fed. Reg. 49603, 49609 (2008).  It thus was possible for Wyeth to label and market Phenergan in compliance with federal law while also providing additional warning information on its label beyond that previously approved by the FDA.  In addition, federal law does not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved drug at all times with the precise label initially approved by the FDA.  The Vermont court\u2019s judgment in this case, therefore, did not directly conflict with federal law and is not pre-empted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately, however, because I cannot join the majority\u2019s implicit endorsement of far-reaching implied pre-emption doctrines.  In particular, I have become increasingly skeptical of this Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence. Under this approach, the Court routinely invalidates state laws based on perceived conflicts with broad federal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not embodied within the text of federal law.  Because implied pre-emption doctrines that wander far from the statutory text are inconsistent with the Constitution, I concur only in the judgment.\nI\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order \u201cto ensure the protection of our fundamental liberties,\u201d Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), the \u201cConstitution establishes a system of dual sovereignty between the States and the Federal Government.\u201d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991).  The Framers adopted this \u201c\u00a0\u2018constitutionally mandated balance of power,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 242, to \u201creduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front,\u201d because a \u201cfederalist structure of joint sovereigns preserves to the people numerous advantages,\u201d such as \u201ca decentralized government that will be more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society\u201d and \u201cincrease[d] opportunity for citizen involvement in democratic processes,\u201d  Gregory, supra, at 458.  Furthermore, as the Framers observed, the \u201ccompound republic of America\u201d provides \u201ca double security \u2026 to the rights of the people\u201d because \u201cthe power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments, and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments.\u201d  The Federalist No. 51, p.\u00a0266 (M. Beloff ed., 2d ed. 1987).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under this federalist system, \u201cthe States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject only to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\u201d  Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990).  In this way, the Supremacy Clause gives the Federal Government \u201ca decided advantage in [a] delicate balance\u201d between federal and state sovereigns.  Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460.  \u201cAs long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States.\u201d  Ibid.  That is an \u201cextraordinary power in a federalist system.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, the States retain substantial sovereign authority.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d); see also Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 713 (1999); Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 918\u2013922 (1997); New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155\u2013156 (1992); Gregory, supra, at 457\u2013459; Tafflin, supra, at 458.  In accordance with the text and structure of the Constitution, \u201c[t]he powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government, are few and defined\u201d and \u201c[t]hose which are to remain in the state governments, are numerous and indefinite.\u201d  The Federalist No. 45, at 237\u2013238.  Indeed, in protecting our constitutional government, \u201cthe preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government.\u201d  Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), quoted in New York v. United States, supra, at 162.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, in order to protect the delicate balance of power mandated by the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause must operate only in accordance with its terms.  The clause provides:\n\u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d  Art. VI, cl.\u00a02.\n\nWith respect to federal laws, then, the Supremacy Clause gives \u201csupreme\u201d status only to those that are \u201cmade in Pursuance\u201d of \u201c[t]his Constitution.\u201d  Ibid.; see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71831, p.\u00a0694 (1833) (hereinafter Story) (\u201cIt will be observed, that the supremacy of the laws is attached to those only, which are made in pursuance of the constitution\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal laws \u201cmade in Pursuance\u201d of the Constitution must comply with two key structural limitations in the Constitution that ensure that the Federal Government does not amass too much power at the expense of the States.  The first structural limitation, which the parties have not raised in this case, is \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s conferral upon Congress of not all governmental powers, but only discrete, enumerated ones.\u201d  Printz, supra, at 919; see also United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618, n.\u00a08 (2000); New York v. United States, supra, at 155\u2013157; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (\u201cThis government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated powers\u201d).[Footnote 1]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second structural limitation is the complex set of procedures that Congress and the President must follow to enact \u201cLaws of the United States.\u201d  See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 945\u2013946 (1983) (setting forth the Constitution\u2019s Bicameral and Presentment Clauses, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a77, cls. 2\u20133, which \u201cprescribe and define the respective functions of the Congress and of the Executive in the legislative process\u201d).  \u201c[T]he Framers were acutely conscious that the bicameral requirement and the Presentment Clauses would serve essential constitutional functions,\u201d Chadha, 462 U. S., at 951, by allowing the passage of legislation only after it has proceeded through \u201ca step-by-step, deliberate and deliberative process,\u201d id., at 959, that was \u201cfinely wrought and exhaustively considered\u201d by the Framers, id., at 951.  The Supremacy Clause thus requires that pre-emptive effect be given only those to federal standards and policies that are set forth in, or necessarily follow from, the statutory text that was produced through the constitutionally required bicameral and presentment procedures.  See 3 J. Story \u00a71831, at 694 (Actions of the Federal Government \u201cwhich are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies,\u201d are not \u201cthe supreme law of the land.  They will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such\u201d).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these constitutional principles, I have become \u201cincreasing[ly] reluctan[t] to expand federal statutes beyond their terms through doctrines of implied pre-emption.\u201d  Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 459 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  My review of this Court\u2019s broad implied pre-emption precedents, particularly its \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence, has increased my concerns that implied pre-emption doctrines have not always been constitutionally applied.  Under the vague and \u201cpotentially boundless\u201d doctrine of \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 907 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting), for example, the Court has pre-empted state law based on its interpretation of broad federal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not contained within the text of federal law.  See, e.g., Pharmaceutical Research and Mfrs. of America v. Walsh, 538 U. S. 644, 678 (2003) (Thomas,\u00a0J., concurring in judgment) (referring to the \u201cconcomitant danger of invoking obstacle pre-emption based on the arbitrary selection of one purpose to the exclusion of others\u201d); Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 388\u2013391 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (criticizing the majority\u2019s reliance on legislative history to discern statutory intent when that intent was \u201cperfectly obvious on the face of th[e] statute\u201d); Geier, supra, at 874\u2013883 (relying on regulatory history, agency comments, and the Government\u2019s litigating position to determine that federal law pre-empted state law).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congressional and agency musings, however, do not satisfy the Art.\u00a0I, \u00a77 requirements for enactment of federal law and, therefore, do not pre-empt state law under the Supremacy Clause.  When analyzing the pre-emptive effect of federal statutes or regulations validly promulgated thereunder, \u201c[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose [must be] sought in the text and structure of the [provision] at issue\u201d to comply with the Constitution.  CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993); see also New York v. FERC, 535 U. S. 1, 18 (2002) (\u201c[A] federal agency may pre-empt state law only when and if it is acting within the scope of its congressional delegated authority \u2026 [for] an agency literally has no power to act, let alone pre-empt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers power upon it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted; second alteration in original)); Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 617 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201ctreating unenacted congressional intent as if it were law would be constitutionally dubious\u201d).  Pre-emption analysis should not be \u201ca freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives, but an inquiry into whether the ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict.\u201d Bates, supra, at 459 (Thomas,\u00a0J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Geier, supra, at 911 (Stevens., J., dissenting) (\u201c[P]re-emption analysis is, or at least should be, a matter of precise statutory [or regulatory] construction rather than an exercise in free-form judicial policymaking\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Pre-emption must turn on whether state law conflicts with the text of the relevant federal statute or with the federal regulations authorized by that text.  See Foster v. Love, 522 U. S. 67, 71 (1997) (finding that conflict pre-emption question \u201cturn[ed] entirely on the meaning of the state and federal statutes\u201d at issue before the Court); see also New York v. FERC, supra, at 19.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has determined that there are two categories of conflict pre-emption, both of which Wyeth contends are at issue in this case.  First, the Court has found pre-emption \u201cwhere compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate commerce.\u201d  Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142\u2013143 (1963).  Second, the Court has determined that federal law pre-empts state law when, \u201cunder the circumstances of [a] particular case, [state] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).[Footnote 2]\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth first contends that \u201cit would have been impossible for it to comply with the state-law duty to modify Phenergan\u2019s labeling without violating federal law.\u201d  Ante, at 6 (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.).  But, as the majority explains, the text of the relevant federal statutory provisions and the corresponding regulations do not directly conflict with the state-law judgment before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has used different formulations of the standard to be used in deciding whether state and federal law conflict, and thus lead to pre-emption, under the \u201cimpossibility\u201d doctrine.  See, e.g., Geier, supra, at 873 (\u201ca case in which state law penalizes what federal law requires\u201d); American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U. S. 214, 227 (1998) (AT&T) (when state-law claims \u201cdirectly conflict\u201d with federal law), cited in Geier, supra, at 874 (describing AT&T as a \u201ccas[e] involving impossibility\u201d); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, supra, at 142\u2013143 (\u201cwhere compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility\u201d). The Court has generally articulated a very narrow \u201cimpossibility standard,\u201d see Crosby, 530 U. S., at 372\u2013373 (citing Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, supra, at 142\u2013143); see also Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64\u201365 (2002); United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 109 (2000)\u2014in part because the overly broad sweep of the Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d approach, see infra, at 13\u201323, has rendered it unnecessary for the Court to rely on \u201cimpossibility\u201d pre-emption.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, in fact, has not explained why a narrow \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d standard is the best proxy for determining when state and federal laws \u201cdirectly conflict\u201d for purposes of the Supremacy Clause.  There could be instances where it is not \u201cphysically impossible\u201d to comply with both state and federal law, even when the state and federal laws give directly conflicting commands.  See Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 225, 260\u2013261 (2000).  For example, if federal law gives an individual the right to engage in certain behavior that state law prohibits, the laws would give contradictory commands notwithstanding the fact that an individual could comply with both by electing to refrain from the covered behavior.  Ibid.  Therefore, \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d may not be the most appropriate standard for determining whether the text of state and federal laws directly conflict.  See ibid.  (concluding that the Supremacy Clause does not limit direct conflicts to cases with \u201cphysically impossible\u201d conflicts and arguing that evidence from the Founding supports a standard of \u201clogical-contradiction\u201d); see also AT&T, supra, at 227 (requiring that the state-law claims \u201cdirectly conflict\u201d with federal law); 3 Story \u00a71836, at 701 (suggesting instead that a state law is pre-empted by the Supremacy Clause when it is \u201crepugnant to the constitution of the United States\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, whatever the precise constitutional contours of implied pre-emption may be, I am satisfied that it does not operate against respondent\u2019s judgment below.  The text of the federal laws at issue do not require that the state-court judgment at issue be pre-empted, under either the narrow \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d standard, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, supra, at 142\u2013143, or a more general \u201cdirec[t] conflict\u201d standard, AT&T, supra, at 227.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the FDA\u2019s \u201cchanges being effected\u201d regulation, 21 CFR \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii), which was promulgated pursuant to the FDA\u2019s statutory authority, it is physically possible for Wyeth to market Phenergan in compliance with federal and Vermont law.  As the majority explains, Wyeth could have changed the warning on its label regarding IV-push without violating federal law.  See ante, at 11\u201313.  The \u201cchanges being effected\u201d regulation allows drug manufacturers to change their labels without the FDA\u2019s preapproval if the changes \u201cadd or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction,\u201d \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or \u201cadd or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u201d \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C), in order to \u201creflect newly acquired information,\u201d including \u201cnew analyses of previously submitted data,\u201d 73 Fed. Reg. 49603, 49609.  Under the terms of these regulations, after learning of new incidences of gangrene-induced amputation resulting from the IV-push administration of Phenergan, see ante, at 12\u201313, federal law gave Wyeth the authority to change Phenergan\u2019s label to \u201cstrengthen a \u2026 warning,\u201d \u201cstrengthen a \u2026 precaution,\u201d \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), or to \u201cstrengthen an instruction about \u2026 administration [of the IV-push method] \u2026 to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u201d \u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C).  Thus, it was physically possible for Wyeth to comply with a state-law requirement to provide stronger warnings on Phenergan about the risks of the IV-push administration method while continuing to market Phenergan in compliance with federal law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the text of the statutory provisions governing FDA drug labeling, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, do not give drug manufacturers an unconditional right to market their federally approved drug at all times with the precise label initially approved by the FDA. Thus, there is no \u201cdirect conflict\u201d between the federal labeling law and the state-court judgment.  The statute prohibits the interstate marketing of any drug, except for those that are federally approved.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(a) (\u201cNo person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug, unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to subsection (b) or (j) of this section is effective with respect to such drug\u201d (emphasis added)).  To say, as the statute does, that Wyeth may not market a drug without federal approval (i.e., without an FDA-approved label) is not to say that federal approval gives Wyeth the unfettered right, for all time, to market its drug with the specific label that was federally approved.  Initial approval of a label amounts to a finding by the FDA that the label is safe for purposes of gaining federal approval to market the drug.  It does not represent a finding that the drug, as labeled, can never be deemed unsafe by later federal action, or as in this case, the application of state law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, FDA regulations require a drug manufacturer\u2014after initial federal approval of a drug\u2019s label\u2014to revise the federally approved label \u201cto include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug.\u201d  21 CFR \u00a7201.80(e).  Drug manufacturers are also required to \u201cestablish and maintain records and make reports\u201d to the FDA about \u201c[a]ny adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related,\u201d after it has received federal approval.  \u00a7\u00a7314.80(a), (c), (j).  In addition, the manufacturer must make periodic reports about \u201cadverse drug experience[s]\u201d associated with its drug and include \u201ca history of actions taken since the last report because of adverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated).\u201d  \u00a7\u00a7314.80(c)(2)(i)\u2013(ii).  When such records and reports are not made, the FDA can withdraw its approval of the drug.  \u00a7314.80(j); see also 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(e) (\u201cThe Secretary may \u2026 withdraw the approval of an application \u2026 if the Secretary finds \u2026 that the applicant has failed to establish a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports\u201d).  The FDA may also determine that a drug is no longer safe for use based on \u201cclinical or other experience, tests, or other scientific data.\u201d  Ibid. (approval may be withdrawn if \u201cthe Secretary finds \u2026 that clinical or other experience, tests, or other scientific data show that such drug is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application was approved\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of the statutory provisions and the accompanying regulatory scheme governing the FDA drug approval process, therefore, establish that the FDA\u2019s initial approval of a drug is not a guarantee that the drug\u2019s label will never need to be changed.  And nothing in the text of the statutory or regulatory scheme necessarily insulates Wyeth from liability under state law simply because the FDA has approved a particular label.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the relevant federal law did not give Wyeth a right that the state-law judgment took away, and it was possible for Wyeth to comply with both federal law and the Vermont-law judgment at issue here.  The federal statute and regulations neither prohibited the stronger warning label required by the state judgment, nor insulated Wyeth from the risk of state-law liability.  With no \u201cdirect conflict\u201d between the federal and state law, then, the state-law judgment is not pre-empted.  Cf. AT&T, 524 U. S., at 221\u2013226 (finding pre-emption where federal law forbade common carriers from extending communications privileges requested by state-law claims); Foster, 522 U. S., at 68\u201369 (finding pre-emption where the federal statute required congressional elections on a particular date different from that provided by state statute).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth also contends that state and federal law conflict because \u201crecognition of [this] state tort action creates an unacceptable \u2018obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u2019 Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury\u2019s decision about drug labeling for the expert judgment of the FDA.\u201d  Ante, at 6\u20137.  This Court\u2019s entire body of \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence is inherently flawed.  The cases improperly rely on legislative history, broad atextual notions of congressional purpose, and even congressional inaction in order to pre-empt state law.  See supra, at 5\u20137.  I, therefore, cannot join the majority\u2019s analysis of this claim, see ante, at 17\u201325, or its reaffirmation of the Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d jurisprudence, ante, at 17\u201318 (analyzing congressional purposes); ante, at 20 (quoting the \u201c\u00a0\u2018purposes and objectives\u2019\u00a0\u201d pre-emption standard from Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), and Geier, 529 U. S., at 883); ante, at 23\u201324, and nn. 13\u201314 (analyzing this case in light of Geier, 529 U. S. 861).\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court first formulated its current \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption standard in Hines when it considered whether the federal Alien Registration Act pre-empted an Alien Registration Act adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The Court did not find that the two statutes, by their terms, directly conflicted.  See Hines, supra, at 59\u201360, and n.\u00a01 (citing Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 35, \u00a7\u00a71801\u20131806 (Purdon Supp. 1940)); 312 U. S., at 60, and n.\u00a05 (citing Act of June 28, 1940, 54 Stat. 670); 312 U. S., at 69\u201374 (analyzing numerous extratextual sources and finding pre-emption without concluding that the terms of the federal and state laws directly conflict); see also id., at 78 (noting that \u201c[i]t is conceded that the federal act in operation does not at any point conflict with the state statute\u201d (Stone, J., dissenting)).[Footnote 3]  Nonetheless, the Court determined that it was not confined to considering merely the terms of the relevant federal law in conducting its pre-emption analysis.  Rather, it went on to ask whether the state law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d  Id., at 67.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In so doing, the Court looked far beyond the relevant federal statutory text and instead embarked on its own freeranging speculation about what the purposes of the federal law must have been.  See id., at 69\u201374.  In addition to the meaning of the relevant federal text, the Court attempted to discern \u201c[t]he nature of the power exerted by Congress, the object sought to be attained, and the character of the obligations imposed by the law.\u201d  Id., at 70.  To do so, the Court looked in part to public sentiment, noting that \u201c[o]pposition to laws \u2026 singling out aliens as particularly dangerous and undesirable groups, is deep-seated in this country.\u201d  Ibid.  The Court also relied on statements by particular Members of Congress and on congressional inaction, finding it pertinent that numerous bills with requirements similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s law had failed to garner enough votes in Congress to become law.  Id., at 71\u201373, and nn.\u00a032\u201334.  Concluding that these sources revealed a federal purpose to \u201cprotect the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system,\u201d the Court held that the Pennsylvania law was pre-empted.  Id., at 74.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stone, in dissent, questioned the majority\u2019s decision to read an exclusive registration system for aliens into a statute that did not specifically provide such exclusivity.  See id., at 75.  He noted his concern that state power would be improperly diminished through a pre-emption doctrine driven by the Court\u2019s \u201cown conceptions of a policy which Congress ha[d] not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it ha[d] enacted.\u201d  Ibid.  In his view, nothing that Congress enacted had \u201cdenie[d] the states the practicable means of identifying their alien residents and of recording their whereabouts.\u201d  Id., at 78.  Yet, the Hines majority employed pre-emption to override numerous state alien-registration laws even though enacted federal law \u201cat no point conflict[ed] with the state legislation and [was] harmonious with it.\u201d  Id., at 79.[Footnote 4]\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consequences of this Court\u2019s broad approach to \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption are exemplified in this Court\u2019s decision in Geier, which both the majority and the dissent incorporate into their analysis today.  See ante, at 23\u201324, and nn. 13\u201314; post, at 6\u20139 (opinion of Alito, J.).  In Geier, pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71381 et seq. (1988 ed.), the Department of Transportation (DOT) had promulgated a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard that \u201crequired auto manufacturers to equip some but not all of their 1987 vehicles with passive restraints.\u201d  529 U. S., at 864\u2013865.  The case required this Court to decide whether the Safety Act pre-empted a state common-law tort action in which the plaintiff claimed that an auto manufacturer, though in compliance with the federal standard, should nonetheless have equipped a 1987 automobile with airbags.  Id., at 865.  The Court first concluded that the Safety Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision and its saving clause, read together, did not expressly pre-empt state common-law claims.  See id., at 867\u2013868.[Footnote 5]  The Court then proceeded to consider whether the state action was nonetheless pre-empted as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the purposes of the federal law.  The Court held that the state tort claim was pre-empted, relying in large part on comments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, statements that the Government made in its brief to the Court, and regulatory history that related to the federal regulation of passive restraints.  See id., at 874\u2013886.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the majority found that DOT intended to \u201cdeliberately provid[e] the manufacturer[s] with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices\u201d and to \u201cbring about a mix of different devices introduced gradually over time,\u201d based on comments that DOT made when promulgating its regulation, rather than the Safety Act\u2019s text.  Id., at 875.  The majority also embarked on a judicial inquiry into \u201cwhy and how DOT sought these objectives,\u201d ibid., by considering regulatory history and the Government\u2019s brief, which described DOT\u2019s safety standard as \u201c\u00a0\u2018embod[ying] the Secretary\u2019s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 881 (quoting Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., O.\u00a0T. 1999, No. 98\u20131811, p.\u00a025); see also 529 U. S., at 883\u2013884.  Based on this \u201cex\u00a0post administrative litigating position and inferences from regulatory history and final commentary,\u201d id., at 910\u2013911 (Stevens., J., dissenting), the Court found that the state action was pre-empted because it would have required manufacturers of all cars similar to that in which the plaintiff was injured to \u201cinstall airbags rather than other passive restraint systems\u201d and would have, therefore, \u201cpresented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought\u201d to phase in gradually, id., at 881.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s decision in Geier to apply \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption based on agency comments, regulatory history, and agency litigating positions was especially flawed, given that it conflicted with the plain statutory text of the saving clause within the Safety Act, which explicitly preserved state common-law actions by providing that \u201c[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law,\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71397(k) (1988 ed.).[Footnote 6]   See Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (\u201cStatutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 98 (1991) (\u201cThe best evidence of th[e] purpose [of a statute] is the statutory text adopted by both Houses of Congress and submitted to the President\u201d).  In addition, the Court\u2019s reliance on its divined purpose of the federal law\u2014to gradually phase in a mix of passive restraint systems\u2014in order to invalidate a State\u2019s imposition of a greater safety standard was contrary to the more general express statutory goal of the Safety Act \u201cto reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents,\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71381 (1988 ed.).  This Court has repeatedly stated that when statutory language is plain, it must be enforced according to its terms.  See Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___ (2009); see also, e.g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359 (2005); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000).  The text in Geier \u201cdirectly addressed the precise question at issue\u201d before the Court, so that should have been \u201cthe end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d  National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 18) (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  With text that allowed state actions like the one at issue in Geier, the Court had no authority to comb through agency commentaries to find a basis for an alternative conclusion.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption in Geier, as in any case, allowed this Court to vacate a judgment issued by another sovereign based on nothing more than assumptions and goals that were untethered from the constitutionally enacted federal law authorizing the federal regulatory standard that was before the Court.  See Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.\u00a0A., 550 U. S. 1, 44 (2007) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that pre-emption \u201caffects the allocation of powers among sovereigns\u201d).  \u201c\u00a0\u2018[A]n agency literally has no power to act, let alone pre-empt the [law] of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\u2019\u00a0\u201d New York v. FERC, 535 U. S., at 18 (quoting Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355, 374 (1986)). Thus, no agency or individual Member of Congress can pre-empt a State\u2019s judgment by merely musing about goals or intentions not found within or authorized by the statutory text.  See supra, at 5\u20137.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence is also problematic because it encourages an overly expansive reading of statutory text.  The Court\u2019s desire to divine the broader purposes of the statute before it inevitably leads it to assume that Congress wanted to pursue those policies \u201cat all costs\u201d\u2014even when the text reflects a different balance.  See Geier, supra, at 904 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (finding no evidence to support the notion that the DOT Secretary intended to advance the purposes of the safety standard \u201cat all costs\u201d); Nelson, 86 Va. L.\u00a0Rev., at 279\u2013280.  As this Court has repeatedly noted, \u201c\u00a0\u2018it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  E.g., Norfolk Southern R.\u00a0Co. v. Sorrell, 549 U. S. 158, 171 (2007) (quoting Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam)).  Federal legislation is often the result of compromise between legislators and \u201cgroups with marked but divergent interests.\u201d  See Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U. S. 81, 93\u201394 (2002).  Thus, a statute\u2019s text might reflect a compromise between parties who wanted to pursue a particular goal to different extents.  See, e.g., ibid. (noting that the Family and Medical Leave Act\u2019s provision of only 12 workweeks of yearly leave \u201cwas the result of compromise\u201d that must be given effect by courts); Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 257 (1984) (finding that a state law was not pre-empted though it allegedly frustrated a primary purpose of the Atomic Energy Act because the Act provided that its purpose was to be furthered only \u201cto the extent it is consistent \u2018with the health and safety of the public\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72013(d) (1982 ed.))); see also Manning, What Divides Textualists from Purposivists? 106 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 70, 104 (2006) (\u201cLegislators may compromise on a statute that does not fully address a perceived mischief, accepting half a loaf to facilitate a law\u2019s enactment\u201d).  Therefore, there is no factual basis for the assumption underlying the Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence that every policy seemingly consistent with federal statutory text has necessarily been authorized by Congress and warrants pre-emptive effect.  Instead, our federal system in general, and the Supremacy Clause in particular, accords pre-emptive effect to only those policies that are actually authorized by and effectuated through the statutory text.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority, while reaching the right conclusion in this case, demonstrates once again how application of \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption requires inquiry into matters beyond the scope of proper judicial review.  For example, the majority relies heavily on Congress\u2019 failure \u201cduring the \u2026 70-year history\u201d of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enact an express pre-emption provision that addresses approval of a drug label by the FDA.  Ante, at 18.  That \u201csilence on the issue, coupled with [Congress\u2019] certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation,\u201d the majority reasons, is evidence that Congress did not intend for federal approval of drug labels to pre-empt state tort judgments.  Ibid.; see also ante, at 17\u201318 (construing from inaction that Congress \u201c[e]vidently [had] determined that widely available state rights of action provided appropriate relief\u201d).  Certainly, the absence of a statutory provision pre-empting all state tort suits related to approved federal drug labels is pertinent to a finding that such lawsuits are not pre-empted.  But the relevance is in the fact that no statute explicitly pre-empts the lawsuits, and not in any inferences that the Court may draw from congressional silence about the motivations or policies underlying Congress\u2019 failure to act.  See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 121 (1994) (\u201c[C]ongressional silence lacks persuasive significance\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); O\u2019Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 512 U. S. 79, 85 (1994) (\u201c[M]atters left unaddressed in [a comprehensive and detailed federal] scheme are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law\u201d); Camps Newfound, 520 U. S., at 616 (\u201c[O]ur pre-emption jurisprudence explicitly rejects the notion that mere congressional silence on a particular issue may be read as pre-empting state law\u201d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, the majority has concluded from silence that Congress believed state lawsuits pose no obstacle to federal drug-approval objectives.  See ante, at 18.  That is the required conclusion, but only because it is compelled by the text of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, not judicial suppositions about Congress\u2019 unstated goals.  The fact that the Court reaches the proper conclusion does not justify its speculation about the reasons for congressional inaction.  In this case, the Court has relied on the perceived congressional policies underlying inaction to find that state law is not pre-empted.  But once the Court shows a willingness to guess at the intent underlying congressional inaction, the Court could just as easily rely on its own perceptions regarding congressional inaction to give unduly broad pre-emptive effect to federal law.  See, e.g., American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 401, 405\u2013408, 429 (2003) (finding that Congress\u2019 failure to pass legislation indicating that it disagreed with the President\u2019s executive agreement supported, at least in part, the Court\u2019s determination that the agreement pre-empted state law).  Either approach is illegitimate.  Under the Supremacy Clause, state law is pre-empted only by federal law \u201cmade in Pursuance\u201d of the Constitution, Art.\u00a0VI, cl. 2\u2014not by extratextual considerations of the purposes underlying congressional inaction.  See Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96, 104 (1989) (plurality opinion) (finding that policy arguments that \u201care not based in the text of the statute \u2026 are not helpful\u201d); TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 194 (1978) (\u201cOur individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of a particular course consciously selected by the Congress is to be put aside in the process of interpreting a statute\u201d).  Our role, then, is merely \u201cto interpret the language of the statute[s] enacted by Congress.\u201d  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461 (2002).\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The origins of this Court\u2019s \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d pre-emption jurisprudence in Hines, and its broad application in cases like Geier, illustrate that this brand of the Court\u2019s pre-emption jurisprudence facilitates freewheeling, extratextual, and broad evaluations of the \u201cpurposes and objectives\u201d embodied within federal law.  This, in turn, leads to decisions giving improperly broad pre-emptive effect to judicially manufactured policies, rather than to the statutory text enacted by Congress pursuant to the Constitution and the agency actions authorized thereby.  Because such a sweeping approach to pre-emption leads to the illegitimate\u2014and thus, unconstitutional\u2014invalidation of state laws, I can no longer assent to a doctrine that pre-empts state laws merely because they \u201cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u201d of federal law, Hines, 312 U. S., at 67, as perceived by this Court.  I therefore respectfully concur only in the judgment.\n\u00a0This structural limitation may be implicated in a pre-emption case if the federal law at issue is beyond the scope of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers.  Expansion of congressional power through an \u201cincreasingly generous \u2026 interpretation of the commerce power of Congress,\u201d for example, creates \u201ca real risk that Congress will gradually erase the diffusion of power between State and Nation on which the Framers based their faith in the efficiency and vitality of our Republic.\u201d Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 583\u2013584 (1985) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (\u201cThe powers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written\u201d).\n\u00a0The majority\u2019s pre-emption analysis relies in part on a presumption against pre-emption.  Ante, at 8, and n.\u00a03 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  Because it is evident from the text of the relevant federal statutes and regulations themselves that the state-law judgment below is not pre-empted, it is not necessary to decide whether, or to what extent, the presumption should apply in a case such as this one, where Congress has not enacted an express-pre-emption clause.  Cf. Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (rejecting the use of a presumption against pre-emption in express pre-emption cases).\n\u00a0 According to the Court, the Pennsylvania Act required:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cevery alien 18 years or over, with certain exceptions, to register once each year; provide such information as is required by the statute, plus any \u2018other information and details\u2019 that the Department of Labor and Industry may direct; pay $1 as an annual registration fee; receive an alien identification card and carry it at all times; show the card whenever it may be demanded by any police officer or any agent of the Department of Labor and Industry; and exhibit the card as a condition precedent to registering a motor vehicle in his name or obtaining a license to operate one. \u2026 Nonexempt aliens who fail to register are subject to a fine \u2026 or imprisonment \u2026\u00a0. For failure to carry an identification card or for failure to show it upon proper demand, the punishment is a fine \u2026 or imprisonment \u2026\u00a0.\u201d Hines, 312 U. S., at 59\u201360 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court explained that the federal Alien Registration Act required:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201ca single registration of aliens 14 years of age and over; detailed information specified by the Act, plus \u2018such additional matters as may be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General\u2019; finger-printing of all registrants; and secrecy of the federal files \u2026\u00a0. No requirement that aliens carry a registration card to be exhibited to police or others is embodied in the law, and only the wilful failure to register is made a criminal offense \u2026\u00a0.\u201d  Id., at 60\u201361.\n\u00a0According to Justice Stone, the Hines majority\u2019s analysis resembled an inquiry into whether the federal act \u201c\u00a0\u2018occupied the field,\u2019\u00a0\u201d rather than an application of simple conflict pre-emption principles.  Id., at 78 (dissenting opinion).  Regardless of whether Hines involved field or conflict pre-emption, the dissent accurately observed that in assessing the boundaries of the federal law\u2014i.e., the scope of its pre-emptive effect\u2014the Court should look to the federal statute itself, rather than speculate about Congress\u2019 unstated intentions.  Id., at 78\u201379.  See also Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 616\u2013617 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201cfield pre-emption is itself suspect, at least as applied in the absence of a congressional command that a particular field be pre-empted\u201d).\n\u00a0The Safety Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision stated in part:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard established under this subchapter is in effect, no State \u2026 shall have any authority either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment[,] any safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical to the Federal standard.\u201d  15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71392(d) (1988 ed.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Safety Act also included a saving clause, which stated: \u201cCompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.\u201d  \u00a71397(k).  The majority and dissent in Geier agreed that the import of the express pre-emption provision and the saving clause, read together, was that by its terms, the Safety Act did not expressly pre-empt state common-law actions.  See Geier, 529 U. S., at 867\u2013868; id., at 895\u2013898 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0In addition to the impropriety of looking beyond the plain text of the saving clause to regulatory history, DOT comments, and an administrative litigating position to evaluate the Safety Act\u2019s pre-emptive effect, it is unclear that the Court in Geier accurately assessed the federal objectives of the relevant federal law.  As the dissent in Geier pointed out, the purpose of the Safety Act, as stated by Congress, was generally \u201c\u00a0\u2018to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries to persons resulting from traffic accidents.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 888\u2013889 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (quoting 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71381 (1988 ed.)).  On its face, that goal is of course consistent with a state-law judgment that a particular vehicle needed a passive restraint system that would better protect persons from death and injury during traffic accidents.  Furthermore, the dissent observed that \u201cby definition all of the standards established under the Safety Act \u2026 impose minimum, rather than fixed or maximum, requirements.\u201d  529 U. S., at 903 (citing 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(2) (1988 ed.)).  Thus, in the dissent\u2019s view, the requirements of the DOT regulation were not ceilings, and it was \u201cobvious that the Secretary favored a more rapid increase\u201d than required by the regulations.  529 U. S., at 903.  That goal also would be consistent with a state-law judgment finding that a manufacturer acted negligently when it failed to include an airbag in a particular car.

State tort law will sometimes help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u201cuncover unknown drug hazards and [encourage] drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks.\u201d  Ante, at 23.  But it is also possible that state tort law will sometimes interfere with the FDA\u2019s desire to create a drug label containing a specific set of cautions and instructions.  I also note that some have argued that state tort law can sometimes raise prices to the point where those who are sick are unable to obtain the drugs they need.  See Lasagna, The Chilling Effect of Product Liability on New Drug Development, in The Liability Maze 334, 335\u2013336 (P. Huber & R. Litan eds. 1991).  The FDA may seek to determine whether and when state tort law acts as a help or a hindrance to achieving the safe drug-related medical care that Congress sought.  Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 506 (1996) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 454\u2013455 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring).  It may seek to embody those determinations in lawful specific regulations describing, for example, when labeling requirements serve as a ceiling as well as a floor.  And it is possible that such determinations would have pre-emptive effect.  See Lohr, supra, at 505 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (citing Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707 (1985)).  I agree with the Court, however, that such a regulation is not at issue in this case.

The Court holds that a state tort jury, rather than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs.  That result cannot be reconciled with Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), or general principles of conflict pre-emption.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court frames the question presented as a \u201cnarro[w]\u201d one\u2014namely, whether Wyeth has a duty to provide \u201can adequate warning about using the IV-push method\u201d to administer Phenergan.  Ante, at 8.  But that ignores the antecedent question of who\u2014the FDA or a jury in Vermont\u2014has the authority and responsibility for determining the \u201cadequacy\u201d of Phenergan\u2019s warnings.  Moreover, it is unclear how a \u201cstronger\u201d warning could have helped respondent, see ante, at 16; after all, the physician\u2019s assistant who treated her disregarded at least six separate warnings that are already on Phenergan\u2019s labeling, so respondent would be hard pressed to prove that a seventh would have made a difference.[Footnote 1]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More to the point, the question presented by this case is not a \u201cnarrow\u201d one, and it does not concern whether Phenergan\u2019s label should bear a \u201cstronger\u201d warning.  Rather, the real issue is whether a state tort jury can countermand the FDA\u2019s considered judgment that Phenergan\u2019s FDA-mandated warning label renders its intravenous (IV) use \u201csafe.\u201d  Indeed, respondent\u2019s amended complaint alleged that Phenergan is \u201cnot reasonably safe for intravenous administration,\u201d App. 15, \u00b66; respondent\u2019s attorney told the jury that Phenergan\u2019s label should say, \u201c\u00a0\u2018Do not use this drug intravenously,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 32; respondent\u2019s expert told the jury, \u201cI think the drug should be labeled \u2018Not for IV use,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 59; and during his closing argument, respondent\u2019s attorney told the jury, \u201cThank God we don\u2019t rely on the FDA to \u2026 make the safe[ty] decision.  You will make the decision. \u2026 The FDA doesn\u2019t make the decision, you do,\u201d id., at 211\u2013212.[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal law, however, does rely on the FDA to make safety determinations like the one it made here.  The FDA has long known about the risks associated with IV push in general and its use to administer Phenergan in particular.  Whether wisely or not, the FDA has concluded\u2014over the course of extensive, 54-year-long regulatory proceedings\u2014that the drug is \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d when used in accordance with its FDA-mandated labeling.  The unfortunate fact that respondent\u2019s healthcare providers ignored Phenergan\u2019s labeling may make this an ideal medical-malpractice case.[Footnote 3]  But turning a common-law tort suit into a \u201cfrontal assault\u201d on the FDA\u2019s regulatory regime for drug labeling upsets the well-settled meaning of the Supremacy Clause and our conflict pre-emption jurisprudence.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21.\nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that \u201c[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), Congress made its \u201cpurpose\u201d plain in authorizing the FDA\u2014not state tort juries\u2014to determine when and under what circumstances a drug is \u201csafe.\u201d  \u201c[T]he process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the premarket approval process for medical devices,\u201d Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), and we held that the latter pre-empted a state-law tort suit that conflicted with the FDA\u2019s determination that a medical device was \u201csafe,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (opinion of the Court).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a drug manufacturer may not market a new drug before first submitting a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA and receiving the agency\u2019s approval.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(a).  An NDA must contain, among other things, \u201cthe labeling proposed to be used for such drug,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(F), \u201cfull reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(A), and \u201ca discussion of why the benefits exceed the risks [of the drug] under the conditions stated in the labeling,\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7314.50(d)(5)(viii) (2008).  The FDA will approve an NDA only if the agency finds, among other things, that the drug is \u201csafe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,\u201d there is \u201csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof,\u201d and the proposed labeling is not \u201cfalse or misleading in any particular.\u201d  21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the FDA approves a drug, the manufacturer remains under an obligation to investigate and report any adverse events associated with the drug, see 21 CFR \u00a7314.80, and must periodically submit any new information that may affect the FDA\u2019s previous conclusions about the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355(k).  If the FDA finds that the drug is not \u201csafe\u201d when used in accordance with its labeling, the agency \u201cshall\u201d withdraw its approval of the drug.  \u00a7355(e).  The FDA also \u201cshall\u201d deem a drug \u201cmisbranded\u201d if \u201cit is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.\u201d  \u00a7352(j).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, a drug\u2019s warning label \u201cserves as the standard under which the FDA determines whether a product is safe and effective.\u201d  50 Fed. Reg. 7470 (1985).  Labeling is \u201c[t]he centerpiece of risk management,\u201d as it \u201ccommunicates to health care practitioners the agency\u2019s formal, authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product can be used safely and effectively.\u201d  71 Fed. Reg. 3934 (2006).  The FDA has underscored the importance it places on drug labels by promulgating comprehensive regulations\u2014spanning an entire part of the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR pt. 201, with seven subparts and 70 separate sections\u2014that set forth drug manufacturers\u2019 labeling obligations.  Under those regulations, the FDA must be satisfied that a drug\u2019s warning label contains, among other things, \u201ca summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug,\u201d \u00a7201.56(1), including a description of \u201cclinically significant adverse reactions,\u201d \u201cother potential safety hazards,\u201d \u201climitations in use imposed by them, \u2026 and steps that should be taken if they occur,\u201d \u00a7201.57(c)(6)(i).  Neither the FDCA nor its implementing regulations suggest that juries may second-guess the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions.\nB\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the FDA determines, in accordance with its statutory mandate, that a drug is on balance \u201csafe,\u201d our conflict pre-emption cases prohibit any State from countermanding that determination.  See, e.g., Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 348 (2001) (after the FDA has struck \u201ca somewhat delicate balance of statutory objectives\u201d and determined that petitioner submitted a valid application to manufacture a medical device, a State may not use common law to negate it); International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987) (after the EPA has struck \u201cthe balance of public and private interests so carefully addressed by\u201d the federal permitting regime for water pollution, a State may not use nuisance law to \u201cupse[t]\u201d it); Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co., 450 U. S. 311, 321 (1981) (after the Interstate Commerce Commission has struck a \u201cbalance\u201d between competing interests in permitting the abandonment of a railroad line, a State may not use statutory or common law to negate it).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, as the Court itself recognizes, it is irrelevant in conflict pre-emption cases whether Congress \u201cenacted an express pre-emption provision at some point during the FDCA\u2019s 70-year history.\u201d  Ante, at 18; see also Geier, 529 U. S., at 869 (holding the absence of an express pre-emption clause \u201cdoes not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles\u201d).  Rather, the ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption turn solely on whether a State has upset the regulatory balance struck by the federal agency.  Id., at 884\u2013885; see also Chicago & North Western Transp. Co., supra, at 317 (describing conflict pre-emption as \u201ca two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the [federal and state laws] and then determining the constitutional question whether they are actually in conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A faithful application of this Court\u2019s conflict pre-emption cases compels the conclusion that the FDA\u2019s 40-year-long effort to regulate the safety and efficacy of Phenergan pre-empts respondent\u2019s tort suit.  Indeed, that result follows directly from our conclusion in Geier.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geier arose under the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act of 1966, which directs the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to \u201cestablish by order \u2026 motor vehicle safety standards,\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71392(a) (1988 ed.), which are defined as \u201cminimum standard[s] for motor vehicle performance, or motor vehicle equipment performance,\u201d \u00a71391(2).  Acting pursuant to that statutory mandate, the Secretary of Transportation promulgated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which required car manufacturers to include passive restraint systems (i.e., devices that work automatically to protect occupants from injury during a collision) in a certain percentage of their cars built in or after 1987.  See 49 CFR \u00a7571.208 (1999).  Standard 208 did not require installation of any particular type of passive restraint; instead, it gave manufacturers the option to install automatic seatbelts, airbags, or any other suitable technology that they might develop, provided the restraint(s) met the performance requirements specified in the rule.  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alexis Geier drove her 1987 Honda Accord into a tree, and although she was wearing her seatbelt, she nonetheless suffered serious injuries.  She then sued Honda under state tort law, alleging that her car was negligently and defectively designed because it lacked a driver\u2019s-side airbag.  She argued that Congress had empowered the Secretary to set only \u201cminimum standard[s]\u201d for vehicle safety.  15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(2).  She also emphasized that the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act contains a saving clause, which provides that \u201c[c]ompliance with any Federal motor vehicle safety standard issued under this subchapter does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.\u201d  \u00a71397(k).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the statute\u2019s saving clause, and notwithstanding the fact that Congress gave the Secretary authority to set only \u201cminimum\u201d safety standards, we held Geier\u2019s state tort suit pre-empted.  In reaching that result, we relied heavily on the view of the Secretary of Transportation\u2014expressed in an amicus brief\u2014that Standard 208 \u201c\u00a0\u2018embodies the Secretary\u2019s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  529 U. S., at 881 (quoting Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, O.\u00a0T. 1999, No. 98\u20131811, p. 25).  Because the Secretary determined that a menu of alternative technologies was \u201csafe,\u201d the doctrine of conflict pre-emption barred Geier\u2019s efforts to deem some of those federally approved alternatives \u201cunsafe\u201d under state tort law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same rationale applies here.  Through Phenergan\u2019s label, the FDA offered medical professionals a menu of federally approved, \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d alternatives\u2014including IV push\u2014for administering the drug.  Through a state tort suit, respondent attempted to deem IV push \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d  To be sure, federal law does not prohibit Wyeth from contraindicating IV push, just as federal law did not prohibit Honda from installing airbags in all its cars.  But just as we held that States may not compel the latter, so, too, are States precluded from compelling the former.  See also Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 155 (1982) (\u201cThe conflict does not evaporate because the [agency\u2019s] regulation simply permits, but does not compel,\u201d the action forbidden by state law).  If anything, a finding of pre-emption is even more appropriate here because the FDCA\u2014unlike the National Traffic and Motor Safety Vehicle Act\u2014contains no evidence that Congress intended the FDA to set only \u201cminimum standards,\u201d and the FDCA does not contain a saving clause.[Footnote 4]  See also ante, at 18 (conceding Congress\u2019 \u201csilence\u201d on the issue).\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its attempt to evade Geier\u2019s applicability to this case, the Court commits both factual and legal errors.  First, as a factual matter, it is demonstrably untrue that the FDA failed to consider (and strike a \u201cbalance\u201d between) the specific costs and benefits associated with IV push.  Second, as a legal matter, Geier does not stand for the legal propositions espoused by the dissenters (and specifically rejected by the majority) in that case.  Third, drug labeling by jury verdict undermines both our broader pre-emption jurisprudence and the broader workability of the federal drug-labeling regime.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phenergan\u2019s warning label has been subject to the FDA\u2019s strict regulatory oversight since the 1950\u2019s.  For at least the last 34 years, the FDA has focused specifically on whether IV-push administration of Phenergan is \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d when performed in accordance with Phenergan\u2019s label.  The agency\u2019s ultimate decision\u2014to retain IV push as one means for administering Phenergan, albeit subject to stringent warnings\u2014is reflected in the plain text of Phenergan\u2019s label (sometimes in boldfaced font and all-capital letters).  And the record contains ample evidence that the FDA specifically considered and reconsidered the strength of Phenergan\u2019s IV-push-related warnings in light of new scientific and medical data.  The majority\u2019s factual assertions to the contrary are mistaken.\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDA\u2019s focus on IV push as a means of administering Phenergan dates back at least to 1975.  In August of that year, several representatives from both the FDA and Wyeth met to discuss Phenergan\u2019s warning label.  At that meeting, the FDA specifically proposed \u201cthat Phenergan Injection should not be used in Tubex\u00ae.\u201d  2 Record 583, 586 (Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exh. 17, Internal Correspondence from W.\u00a0E. Langeland to File (Sept. 5, 1975) (hereinafter 1975 Memo)).  \u201cTubex\u201d is a syringe system used exclusively for IV push.  See App. 43.  An FDA official explained that the agency\u2019s concerns arose from medical-malpractice lawsuits involving IV push of the drug, see 1975 Memo 586, and that the FDA was aware of \u201c5 cases involving amputation where the drug had been administered by Tubex together with several additional cases involving necrosis,\u201d id., at 586\u2013587.  Rather than contraindicating Phenergan for IV push, however, the agency and Wyeth agreed \u201cthat there was a need for better instruction regarding the problems of intraarterial injection.\u201d  Id., at 587.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next year, the FDA convened an advisory committee to study, among other things, the risks associated with the Tubex system and IV push.  App. 294.  At the conclusion of its study, the committee recommended an additional IV-push-specific warning for Phenergan\u2019s label, see ibid., but did not recommend eliminating IV push from the drug label altogether.  In response to the committee\u2019s recommendations, the FDA instructed Wyeth to make several changes to strengthen Phenergan\u2019s label, including the addition of upper case warnings related to IV push.  See id., at 279\u2013280, 282\u2013283.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1987, the FDA directed Wyeth to amend its label to include the following text:  \n\u201c\u00a0\u2018[1] When used intravenously, [Phenergan] should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg/ml and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg/minute. [2] Injection through a properly running intravenous infusion may enhance the possibility of detecting arterial placement.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 311\u2013312.\n\nThe first of the two quoted sentences refers specifically to IV push; as respondent\u2019s medical expert testified at trial, the label\u2019s recommended rate of administration (not to exceed 25 mg per minute) refers to \u201cIV push, as opposed to say being in a bag and dripped over a couple of hours.\u201d  Id., at 52.  The second of the two quoted sentences refers to IV drip.  See id., at 15\u201316 (emphasizing that a \u201crunning IV\u201d is the same thing as \u201cIV drip\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its 1987 labeling order, the FDA cited voluminous materials to \u201csuppor[t]\u201d its new and stronger warnings related to IV push and the preferability of IV drip.[Footnote 5]  Id., at 313.  One of those articles specifically discussed the relative advantages and disadvantages of IV drip compared to IV push, as well as the costs and benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push.[Footnote 6]  The FDA also cited published case reports from the 1960\u2019s of gangrene caused by the intra-arterial injection of Phenergan,[Footnote 7] and the FDA instructed Wyeth to amend Phenergan\u2019s label in accordance with the latest medical research.[Footnote 8]  The FDA also studied drugs similar to Phenergan and cited numerous cautionary articles\u2014one of which urged the agency to consider contraindicating such drugs for IV use altogether.[Footnote 9]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In \u201csupport\u201d of its labeling order, the FDA also cited numerous articles that singled out the inner crook of the elbow\u2014known as the \u201cantecubital fossa\u201d in the medical community\u2014which is both a commonly used injection site, see id., at 70 (noting that respondent\u2019s injection was pushed into \u201cthe antecubital space\u201d), and a universally recognized high-risk area for inadvertent intra-arterial injections.  One of the articles explained:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBecause of the numerous superficial positions the ulnar artery might occupy, it has often been entered during attempted venipuncture [of the antecubital fossa]. \u2026  However, the brachial and the radial arteries might also be quite superficial in the elbow region\u2026\u00a0.  The arterial variations of the arm, especially in and about the cubital fossa, are common and numerous.  If venipuncture must be performed in this area, a higher index of suspicion must be maintained to forestall misdirected injections.\u201d  Stone & Donnelly, The Accidental Intra-arterial Injection of Thiopental, 22 Anesthesiology 995, 996 (1961) (footnote omitted; cited in App. 315, no.\u00a020).[Footnote 10]\n\nBased on this and other research, the FDA ordered Wyeth to include a specific warning related to the use of the antecubital space for IV push.[Footnote 11]\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When respondent was injured in 2000, Phenergan\u2019s label specifically addressed IV push in several passages (sometimes in lieu of and sometimes in addition to those discussed above).  For example, the label warned of the risks of intra-arterial injection associated with \u201caspiration,\u201d which is a technique used only in conjunction with IV push.[Footnote 12]  The label also cautioned against the use of \u201csyringes with rigid plungers,\u201d App. 390, which are used only to administer the drug via IV push.  As respondent\u2019s medical expert testified at trial, \u201cby talking plungers and rigid needles, that\u2019s the way you do it, to push it with the plunger.\u201d  Id., at 53 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew).  Moreover, Phenergan\u2019s 2000 label devoted almost a full page to discussing the \u201cTubex system,\u201d see id., at 391, which, as noted above, is used only to administer the drug via IV push.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Phenergan\u2019s label very clearly authorized the use of IV push, it also made clear that IV push is the delivery method of last resort.  The label specified that \u201c[t]he preferred parenteral route of administration is by deep intramuscular injection.\u201d  Id., at 390.  If an intramuscular injection is ineffective, then \u201cit is usually preferable to inject [Phenergan] through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily.\u201d  Ibid.  See also id., at 50\u201351 (testimony of respondent\u2019s medical expert, Dr. John Matthew) (conceding that the best way to determine that an IV set is functioning satisfactorily is to use IV drip).  Finally, if for whatever reason a medical professional chooses to use IV push, he or she is on notice that \u201cINADVERTENT INTRA-ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED EXTREMITY.\u201d  Id., at 391; see also id., at 390 (\u201cUnder no circumstances should Phenergan Injection be given by intra-arterial injection due to the likelihood of severe arteriospasm and the possibility of resultant gangrene\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phenergan\u2019s label also directs medical practitioners to choose veins wisely when using IV push:\n\u201cDue to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection.  Reports compatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan Injection, usually in conjunction with other drugs intended for intravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation, severe spasm of distal vessels, and resultant gangrene requiring amputation are likely under such circumstances.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it is demonstrably untrue that, as of 2000, Phenergan\u2019s \u201clabeling did not contain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push administration.\u201d  Ante, at 4.  And whatever else might be said about the extensive medical authorities and case reports that the FDA cited in \u201csupport\u201d of its approval of IV-push administration of Phenergan, it cannot be said that the FDA \u201cpaid no more than passing attention to\u201d IV push, ante, at 6; nor can it be said that the FDA failed to weigh its costs and benefits, Brief for Respondent 50.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For her part, respondent does not dispute the FDA\u2019s conclusion that IV push has certain benefits.  At trial, her medical practitioners testified that they used IV push in order to help her \u201cin a swift and timely way\u201d when she showed up at the hospital for the second time in one day complaining of \u201cintractable\u201d migraines, \u201cterrible pain,\u201d inability to \u201cbear light or sound,\u201d sleeplessness, hours-long spasms of \u201cretching\u201d and \u201cvomiting,\u201d and when \u201cevery possible\u201d alternative treatment had \u201cfailed.\u201d  App. 40 (testimony of Dr. John Matthew); id., at 103, 106, 109 (testimony of physician\u2019s assistant Jessica Fisch).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than disputing the benefits of IV push, respondent complains that the FDA and Wyeth underestimated its costs (and hence did not provide sufficient warnings regarding its risks).  But when the FDA mandated that Phenergan\u2019s label read, \u201cINADVERTENT INTRA-ARTERIAL INJECTION CAN RESULT IN GANGRENE OF THE AFFECTED EXTREMITY,\u201d id., at 391, and when the FDA required Wyeth to warn that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances should Phenergan Injection be given by intra-arterial injection,\u201d id., at 390, the agency could reasonably assume that medical professionals would take care not to inject Phenergan intra-arterially.  See also 71 Fed. Reg. 3934 (noting that a drug\u2019s warning label \u201ccommunicates to health care practitioners the agency\u2019s formal, authoritative conclusions regarding the conditions under which the product can be used safely and effectively\u201d).  Unfortunately, the physician\u2019s assistant who treated respondent in this case disregarded Phenergan\u2019s label and pushed the drug into the single spot on her arm that is most likely to cause an inadvertent intra-arterial injection.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, when the FDA approved Phenergan\u2019s label, it was textbook medical knowledge that the \u201cantecubital fossa\u201d creates a high risk of inadvertent intra-arterial injection, given the close proximity of veins and arteries.  See supra, at 13\u201314; see also The Lippincott Manual of Nursing Practice 99 (7th ed. 2001) (noting, in a red-text \u201cNURSING ALERT,\u201d that the antecubital fossa is \u201cnot recommended\u201d for administering dangerous drugs, \u201cdue to the potential for extravasation\u201d).[Footnote 13]  According to the physician\u2019s assistant who injured respondent, however, \u201c[i]t never crossed my mind\u201d that an antecubital injection of Phenergan could hit an artery.  App. 110; see also ibid. (\u201c[It] just wasn\u2019t something that I was aware of at the time\u201d).  Oblivious to the risks emphasized in Phenergan\u2019s warnings, the physician\u2019s assistant pushed a double dose of the drug into an antecubital artery over the course of \u201c[p]robably about three to four minutes,\u201d id., at 111; id., at 105, notwithstanding respondent\u2019s complaints of a \u201c\u00a0\u2018burn[ing]\u2019\u00a0\u201d sensation that she subsequently described as \u201c\u00a0\u2018one of the most extreme pains that I\u2019ve ever felt,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 110, 180\u2013181.  And when asked why she ignored Phenergan\u2019s label and failed to stop pushing the drug after respondent complained of burning pains, the physician\u2019s assistant explained that it would have been \u201cjust crazy\u201d to \u201cworr[y] about an [intra-arterial] injection\u201d under the circumstances, id., at 111.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDA, however, did not think that the risks associated with IV push\u2014especially in the antecubital space\u2014were \u201cjust crazy.\u201d  That is why Phenergan\u2019s label so clearly warns against them.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the \u201cbalance\u201d that the FDA struck between the costs and benefits of administering Phenergan via IV push, Geier compels the pre-emption of tort suits (like this one) that would upset that balance.  The contrary conclusion requires turning yesterday\u2019s dissent into today\u2019s majority opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court denies the existence of a federal-state conflict in this case because Vermont merely countermanded the FDA\u2019s determination that IV push is \u201csafe\u201d when performed in accordance with Phenergan\u2019s warning label; the Court concludes that there is no conflict because Vermont did not \u201cmandate a particular\u201d label as a \u201creplacement\u201d for the one that the jury nullified, and because the State stopped short of altogether \u201ccontraindicating IV-push administration.\u201d  Ante, at 8.  But as we emphasized in Geier (over the dissent\u2019s assertions to the contrary), the degree of a State\u2019s intrusion upon federal law is irrelevant\u2014the Supremacy Clause applies with equal force to a state tort law that merely countermands a federal safety determination and to a state law that altogether prohibits car manufacturers from selling cars without airbags.  Compare 529 U. S., at 881\u2013882, with id., at 902 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Indeed, as recently as last Term, we held that the Supremacy Clause pre-empts a \u201c[s]tate tort law that requires a manufacturer\u2019s catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved\u00a0\u2026\u00a0.\u201d  Riegel, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  It did not matter there that the State stopped short of altogether prohibiting the use of FDA-approved catheters\u2014just as it does not matter here that Vermont stopped short of altogether prohibiting an FDA-approved method for administering Phenergan.  See also Lohr, 518 U. S., at 504 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting it would be an \u201canomalous result\u201d if pre-emption applied differently to a state tort suit premised on the inadequacy of the FDA\u2019s safety regulations and a state law that specifically prohibited an FDA-approved design).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court today distinguishes Geier because the FDA articulated its pre-emptive intent \u201cwithout offering States or other interested parties notice or opportunity for comment.\u201d  Ante, at 21; see also ante, at 24.  But the Geier Court specifically rejected the argument (again made by the dissenters in that case) that conflict pre-emption is appropriate only where the agency expresses its pre-emptive intent through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  Compare 529 U. S., at 885 (\u201cTo insist on a specific expression of agency intent to pre-empt, made after notice-and-comment rulemaking, would be in certain cases to tolerate conflicts that an agency, and therefore Congress, is most unlikely to have intended.  The dissent, as we have said, apparently welcomes that result \u2026\u00a0.  We do not\u201d), with id., at 908\u2013910 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (emphasizing that \u201cwe generally expect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to pre-empt state law with some specificity,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his expectation \u2026 serves to ensure that States will be able to have a dialog with agencies regarding pre-emption decisions ex ante through the normal notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, pre-emption is arguably more appropriate here than in Geier because the FDA (unlike the DOT) declared its pre-emptive intent in the Federal Register.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 3933\u20133936.  Yet the majority dismisses the FDA\u2019s published preamble as \u201cinherently suspect,\u201d ante, at 21, and an afterthought that is entitled to \u201cno weight,\u201d ante, at 25.  Compare Lohr, supra, at 506 (opinion of Breyer, J.) (emphasizing that the FDA has a \u201cspecial understanding of the likely impact of both state and federal requirements, as well as an understanding of whether (or the extent to which) state requirements may interfere with federal objectives,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he FDA can translate these understandings into particularized pre-emptive intentions \u2026 through statements in \u2018regulations, pre-\nambles, interpretive statements, and responses to\ncomments\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the Court distinguishes Geier because the DOT\u2019s regulation \u201cbear[s] the force of law,\u201d whereas the FDA\u2019s preamble does not.  Ante, at 24; see also ante, at 19.  But it is irrelevant that the FDA\u2019s preamble does not \u201cbear the force of law\u201d because the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions surely do.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355.  It is well within the FDA\u2019s discretion to make its labeling decisions through administrative adjudications rather than through less-formal and less-flexible rulemaking proceedings, see SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194 (1947), and we have never previously held that our pre-emption analysis turns on the agency\u2019s choice of the latter over the former.  Moreover, it cannot be said that Geier\u2019s outcome hinged on the agency\u2019s choice to promulgate a rule.  See ante, at 19, 24.  The Geier Court relied\u2014again over the dissenters\u2019 protestations\u2014on materials other than the Secretary\u2019s regulation to explain the conflict between state and federal law.  Compare 529 U. S., at 881, with id., at 899\u2013900 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and ante, at 1\u20132 (Breyer, J., concurring).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Court sandwiches its discussion of Geier between the \u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201d ante, at 18, and heavy emphasis on \u201cthe longstanding coexistence of state and federal law and the FDA\u2019s traditional recognition of state-law remedies,\u201d ante, at 24.  But the Geier Court specifically rejected the argument (again made by the dissenters in that case) that the \u201cpresumption against pre-emption\u201d is relevant to the conflict pre-emption analysis.  See 529 U. S., at 906\u2013907 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he Court simply ignores the presumption [against pre-emption]\u201d).  Rather than invoking such a \u201cpresumption,\u201d the Court emphasized that it was applying \u201cordinary,\u201d \u201clongstanding,\u201d and \u201cexperience-proved principles of conflict pre-emption.\u201d  Id., at 874.  Under these principles, the sole question is whether there is an \u201cactual conflict\u201d between state and federal law; if so, then pre-emption follows automatically by operation of the Supremacy Clause.  Id., at 871\u2013872.  See also Buckman, 531 U. S., at 347\u2013348 (\u201c[P]etitioner\u2019s dealings with the FDA were prompted by [federal law], and the very subject matter of petitioner\u2019s statements [to the FDA] were dictated by [federal law].  Accordingly\u2014and in contrast to situations implicating \u2018federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety\u2019\u2014no presumption against pre-emption obtains in this case\u201d (citation omitted)).[Footnote 14]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Geier Court went out of its way to emphasize (yet again over the dissenters\u2019 objections) that it placed \u201csome weight\u201d on the DOT\u2019s amicus brief, which explained the agency\u2019s regulatory objectives and the effects of state tort suits on the federal regulatory regime.  529 U. S., at 883; compare id., at 910\u2013911 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for \u201cuph[olding] a regulatory claim of frustration-of-purposes implied conflict pre-emption based on nothing more than an ex post administrative litigating position and inferences from regulatory history and final commentary\u201d).  See also Lohr, 518 U. S., at 496 (recognizing that the FDA is \u201cuniquely qualified\u201d to explain whether state law conflicts with the FDA\u2019s objectives).  Yet today, the FDA\u2019s explanation of the conflict between state tort suits and the federal labeling regime, set forth in the agency\u2019s amicus brief, is not even mentioned in the Court\u2019s opinion.  Instead of relying on the FDA\u2019s explanation of its own regulatory purposes, the Court relies on a decade-old and now-repudiated statement, which the majority finds preferable.  See ante, at 21\u201322, 24, n.\u00a013.  Cf. Riegel, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (noting that \u201cthe agency\u2019s earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length and finds preferable) is \u2026 compromised, indeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency\u2019s position\u201d (citation omitted)); Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16\u201317) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 reliance on the pre-emptive effect of the agency\u2019s \u201clongstanding policy\u201d because it is inconsistent with the agency\u2019s current one).  And Justice Breyer suggests that state tort suits may \u201chelp the [FDA],\u201d ante, at 1 (concurring opinion), notwithstanding the FDA\u2019s insistence that state tort suits will \u201cdisrupt the agency\u2019s balancing of health risks and benefits,\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Geier does not countenance the use of state tort suits to second-guess the FDA\u2019s labeling decisions.  And the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion has potentially far-reaching consequences.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By their very nature, juries are ill-equipped to perform the FDA\u2019s cost-benefit-balancing function.  As we explained in Riegel, juries tend to focus on the risk of a particular product\u2019s design or warning label that arguably contributed to a particular plaintiff\u2019s injury, not on the overall benefits of that design or label; \u201cthe patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court.\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Indeed, patients like respondent are the only ones whom tort juries ever see, and for a patient like respondent\u2014who has already suffered a tragic accident\u2014Phenergan\u2019s risks are no longer a matter of probabilities and potentialities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, the FDA has the benefit of the long view.  Its drug-approval determinations consider the interests of all potential users of a drug, including \u201cthose who would suffer without new medical [products]\u201d if juries in all 50 States were free to contradict the FDA\u2019s expert determinations.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  And the FDA conveys its warnings with one voice, rather than whipsawing the medical community with 50 (or more) potentially conflicting ones.  After today\u2019s ruling, however, parochialism may prevail.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem is well illustrated by the labels borne by \u201cvesicant\u201d drugs, many of which are used for chemotherapy.  As a class, vesicants are much more dangerous than drugs like Phenergan,[Footnote 15] but the vast majority of vesicant labels\u2014like Phenergan\u2019s\u2014either allow or do not disallow IV push.  See Appendix, infra.  Because vesicant extravasation can have devastating consequences, and because the potentially lifesaving benefits of these drugs offer hollow solace to the victim of such a tragedy, a jury\u2019s cost-benefit analysis in a particular case may well differ from the FDA\u2019s.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, consider Mustargen (mechlorethamine HCl)\u2014the injectable form of mustard gas\u2014which can be used as an anticancer drug.  Mustargen\u2019s FDA-approved label warns in several places that \u201cThis drug is HIGHLY TOXIC.\u201d[Footnote 16]  Indeed, the drug is so highly toxic:\n\u201cShould accidental eye contact occur, copious irrigation for at least 15 minutes with water, normal saline or a balanced salt ophthalmic irrigating solution should be instituted immediately, followed by prompt ophthalmologic consultation.  Should accidental skin contact occur, the affected part must be irrigated immediately with copious amounts of water, for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes, followed by 2% sodium thiosulfate solution.  Medical attention should be sought immediately.  Contaminated clothing should be destroyed.\u201d[Footnote 17]  \n\nYet when it comes to administering this highly toxic drug, the label provides that \u201cthe drug may be injected directly into any suitable vein, [but] it is injected preferably into the rubber or plastic tubing of a flowing intravenous infusion set.  This reduces the possibility of severe local reactions due to extravasation or high concentration of the drug.\u201d  (Emphasis added.)  Similarly, the FDA-approved labels for other powerful chemotherapeutic vesicants\u2014including Dactinomycin, Oxaliplatin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine\u2014specifically allow IV push, notwithstanding their devastating effects when extravasated.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the labels for such drugs allow IV push is striking\u2014both because vesicants are much more dangerous than Phenergan, and also because they are so frequently extravasated, see Boyle & Engelking, Vesicant Extravasation: Myths and Realities, 22 Oncology Nursing Forum 57, 58 (1995) (arguing that the rate of extravasation is \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d than 6.4% of all vesicant administrations).  Regardless of the FDA\u2019s reasons for not contraindicating IV push for these drugs, it is odd (to say the least) that a jury in Vermont can now order for Phenergan what the FDA has chosen not to order for mustard gas.[Footnote 18]\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, state tort suits can peacefully coexist with the FDA\u2019s labeling regime, and they have done so for decades.  Ante, at 17\u201318.  But this case is far from peaceful coexistence.  The FDA told Wyeth that Phenergan\u2019s label renders its use \u201csafe.\u201d  But the State of Vermont, through its tort law, said: \u201cNot so.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The state-law rule at issue here is squarely pre-empted.   Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Vermont.\n\nAppendix TO OPINION OF ALITO, J.\nVesicant1\n\nIV Push2\n\n\nDactinomycin\n\n\nSpecifically allowed\n\n\nMechlorethamine (Mustargen)\n\n\nSpecifically allowed\n\n\nOxaliplatin\n\n\nSpecifically allowed\n\n\nVinblastine\n\n\nSpecifically allowed\n\n\nVincristine\n\n\nSpecifically allowed\n\n\nBleomycin\n\n\nNeither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n\nCarboplatin\n\n\nNeither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n\nDacarbazine\n\n\nNeither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n\nMitomycin\n\n\nNeither mentioned nor prohibited\n\n\nCarmustine\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nCisplatin\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nEpirubicin\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nEtoposide\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nIfosfamide\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nMitoxantrone\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nPaclitaxel\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nTeniposide\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nVinorelbine\n\n\nNot prohibited; IV drip recommended\n\n\nDaunorubicin\n\n\nProhibited\n\nDoxorubicin\n\n\nProhibited\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01\u00a0Wilkes & Barton-Burke, 2008 Oncology Nursing Drug Handbook 27\u201333 (2008) (Table 1.6).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0IV-push information is derived from the \u201cdosage and administration\u201d sections of individual drug labels (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n\u00a0Indeed, respondent conceded below that Wyeth did propose an adequate warning of Phenergan\u2019s risks.  See Plaintiff Diana Levine\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Wyeth\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in Levine v. American Home Products Corp. (now Wyeth), No. 670\u201312\u201301 Wncv (Super. Ct. Washington Cty., Vt.), \u00b67, p.\u00a026.  Specifically, respondent noted: \u201cIn 1988, Wyeth proposed language that would have prevented this accident by requiring a running IV and explaining why a running IV will address and reduce the risk [of intra-arterial injection].\u201d  Ibid.  See also id., at 24 (\u201cAlthough not strong enough, this improved the labeling instruction, if followed, would have prevented the inadvertent administration of Phenergan into an artery \u2026\u201d).  The FDA rejected Wyeth\u2019s proposal.  See App. 359.\n\u00a0Moreover, in the trial judge\u2019s final charge, he told the jury that \u201cthe critical factual issue which you must decide\u201d is whether Phenergan\u2019s FDA-mandated label reflects a proper balance between \u201cthe risks and benefits of intravenous administration and the potential for injury to patients.\u201d  Id., at 220.  See also ___ Vt. ___, ___, 944 A.\u00a02d 179, 182 (2006) (recognizing that respondent\u2019s argument is that Phenergan\u2019s \u201clabel should not have allowed IV push as a means of administration\u201d).\n\u00a0Respondent sued her physician, physician\u2019s assistant, and hospital for malpractice.  After the parties settled that suit for an undisclosed sum, respondent\u2019s physician sent her a letter in which he admitted \u201cresponsibility\u201d for her injury and expressed his \u201cprofoun[d] regre[t]\u201d and \u201cremors[e]\u201d for his actions.  1 Tr. 178\u2013179 (Mar. 8, 2004) (testimony of Dr. John Matthew); see also App. 102\u2013103 (testimony of physician\u2019s assistant Jessica Fisch) (noting that her \u201csense of grief\u201d was so \u201cgreat\u201d that she \u201cwould have gladly cut off [her own] arm\u201d and given it to respondent).  Thereafter, both the physician and the physician\u2019s assistant agreed to testify on respondent\u2019s behalf in her suit against Wyeth.\n\u00a0To be sure, Congress recognized the principles of conflict pre-emption in the FDCA.  See Drug Amendments of 1962, \u00a7202, 76 Stat. 793 (\u201cNothing in the amendments made by this Act to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall be construed as invalidating any provision of State law \u2026 unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State law\u201d).  But a provision that simply recognizes the background principles of conflict pre-emption is not a traditional \u201csaving clause,\u201d and even if it were, it would not displace our conflict-pre-emption analysis.  See Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869 (2000) (\u201c[T]he saving clause \u2026 does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles\u201d); id., at 873\u2013874 (\u201cThe Court has \u2026 refused to read general \u2018saving\u2019 provisions to tolerate actual conflict both in cases involving impossibility and in \u2018frustration-of-purpose\u2019 cases\u201d (emphasis deleted and citation omitted)).\n\u00a0The FDA cited numerous articles that generally discuss the costs and benefits associated with IV push.  See, e.g., Nahrwold & Phelps, Inadvertent Intra-Arterial Injection of Mephenteramine, 70 Rocky Mountain Medical J. 38 (Sept. 1973) (cited in App. 314, no.\u00a014); Albo, Cheung, Ruth, Snyder, & Beemtsma, Effect of Intra-Arterial Injections of Barbituates, 120 Am.

The FDA required Wyeth to include Hager and Wilson\u2019s observations on Phenergan\u2019s label.  See App. 311 (requiring the label to warn that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he first sign [of an intra-arterial injection] may be the patient\u2019s reaction to a sensation of fiery burning\u2019\u00a0\u201d pain and \u201c\u00a0\u2018[b]lanching\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\n\u00a0See Enloe 427 (discussing hydroxyzine\u2014an antihistamine with chemical properties similar to those of Phenergan\u2014and suggesting its \u201ctemporary\u201d benefits can never outweigh the risks of intra-arterial injection); see also Goldsmith & Trieger, Accidental Intra-Arterial Injection: A Medical Emergency, 22 Anesthesia Progress 180 (1975) (noting the risks of intra-arterial administration of hydroxyzine) (cited in App. 315, no.\u00a018); Klatte, Brooks, & Rhamy, Toxicity of Intra-Arterial Barbituates and Tranquilizing Drugs, 92 Radiology 700 (1969) (same) (cited in App. 314, no.\u00a013).  With full knowledge of those risks, FDA retained IV push for Phenergan, although the agency required Wyeth to incorporate observations from the Enloe article into Phenergan\u2019s label.  Compare Enloe 427 (arguing that \u201cevery precaution should be taken to avoid inadvertent intra-arterial injection,\u201d including the use of \u201can obviously well-functioning venoclysis\u201d), with App. 312 (FDA\u2019s 1987 changes to Phenergan\u2019s label).  In contrast, at some time around 1970, the FDA prohibited all intravenous use of hydroxyzine.  See id., at 79 (testimony of Dr. Harold Green).  The FDA\u2019s decision to regulate the two drugs differently\u2014notwithstanding (1) the agency\u2019s knowledge of the risks associated with both drugs and (2) the agency\u2019s recognition of the relevance of hydroxyzine-related articles and case reports in its regulation of Phenergan\u2014further demonstrates that the FDA intentionally preserved IV-push administration for Phenergan.  See also Haas, Correspondence, 33 Anesthesia Progress 281 (1986) (\u201c[Hydroxyzine\u2019s] restriction does not lie with the medicine itself, but in the practice and malpractice of intravenous techniques.  Unfortunately, the practitioner who knows how to treat injection technique problems is usually not the practitioner with the intravenous technique problems\u201d).\n\u00a0See also Engler, Freeman, Kanavage, Ogden, & Moretz, Production of Gangrenous Extremities by Intra-Arterial Injections, 30 Am. Surgeon 602 (1964) (\u201cAccidental arterial injection most often occurs in the antecubital region because this is a favorite site for venopuncture and in this area the ulnar and brachial arteries are superficial and easily entered\u201d (cited in App. 313, no. 6)); Engler, Gangrenous Extremities Resulting from Intra-arterial Injections, 94 Archives of Surgery 644 (1966) (similar) (cited in App. 314, no. 16); Lynas & Bisset, Intra-arterial Thiopentone, 24 Anaesthesia 257 (1969) (\u201cMost [anesthesiologists] agree that injections on the medial aspect of the antecubital fossa are best avoided\u201d (cited in App. 314, no. 8)); Waters, Intra-arterial Thiopentone, 21 Anesthesia 346 (1966) (\u201cThe risk of producing gangrene of the forearm by accidental injection of sodium thiopentone into an artery at the elbow has been recognised for many years\u201d (cited in App. 314, no. 10)); see also Hager & Wilson, 94 Archives of Surgery, at 88 (emphasizing that one of the best ways to prevent inadvertent intra-arterial injections is to be aware of \u201caberrant or superficial arteries at the antecubital, forearm, wrist, and hand level\u201d); Mostafavi & Samimi, supra (warning against antecubital injections).\n\u00a0See App. 311 (requiring Phenergan\u2019s label to warn that practitioners should \u201c\u00a0\u2018[b]eware of the close proximity of arteries and veins at commonly used injection sites and consider the possibility of aberrant arteries\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\n\u00a0\u201cAspiration\u201d refers to drawing a small amount of blood back into the needle to determine whether the needle is in an artery or a vein.  Ordinarily, arterial blood is brighter than venous blood\u2014but contact with Phenergan causes discoloration, which makes aspiration an unreliable method of protecting against intra-arterial injection.  See id., at 282.  Therefore, the label warned that when using IV push, a medical professional should beware that \u201c[a]spiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored upon contact with Phenergan Injection.\u201d  Id., at 390.\n\u00a0In addition, respondent\u2019s own medical expert testified at trial that it is a principle of \u201cbasic anatomy\u201d that the antecubital fossa contains aberrant arteries.  See 2 Tr. 34\u201335 (Mar. 9, 2004) (testimony of Dr. Daniel O\u2019Brien); see also ibid. (noting that Gray\u2019s Anatomy, which is \u201cthe Bible of anatomy,\u201d also warns of arteries in the antecubital space).\n\u00a0Thus, it is not true that \u201cthis Court has long\u201d applied a presumption against pre-emption in conflict pre-emption cases.  Ante, at 9, n.\u00a03 (majority opinion).  As long ago as Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210 (1824), the Court inquired whether a state law \u201cinterfer[ed] with,\u201d was \u201ccontrary to,\u201d or \u201cc[a]me into collision with\u201d federal law\u2014and it did so without ever invoking a \u201cpresumption.\u201d  See also Davis, Unmasking the Presumption in Favor of Preemption, 53 S.\u00a0C. L.\u00a0Rev. 967, 974 (2002) (noting that many of the Court\u2019s early pre-emption cases \u201cresulted in almost automatic preemption of concurrent state regulation\u201d).  In subsequent years the Court has sometimes acknowledged a limited \u201cpresumption against pre-emption,\u201d but it nonetheless remained an open question\u2014before today\u2014whether that presumption applied in conflict pre-emption cases.  See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 374, n.\u00a08 (2000) (\u201cWe leave for another day a consideration in this context of a presumption against preemption\u201d).  Moreover, this Court has never held that the \u201cpresumption\u201d applies in an area\u2014such as drug labeling\u2014that has long been \u201creserved for federal regulation.\u201d  United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 111 (2000).  See also Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347\u2013348 (2001).\n\u00a0Vesicants may cause \u201cblistering, severe tissue injury, or tissue necrosis\u201d upon extravasation\u2014even if the drug is not injected into an artery.  See, e.g., Schulmeister, Administering Vesicants, 9 Clinical J. of Oncology Nursing 469, 469\u2013470 (2005).  See also ante, at 4 (majority opinion) (noting that Phenergan is labeled as an \u201cirritant\u201d); cf.

LEVINE\ncertiorari to the supreme court of vermont\nNo. 06\u20131249.\u2003Argued November 3, 2008\u2014Decided March 4, 2009\nPetitioner Wyeth manufactures the antinausea drug Phenergan.  After a clinician injected respondent Levine with Phenergan by the \u201cIV-push\u201d method, whereby a drug is injected directly into a patient\u2019s vein, the drug entered Levine\u2019s artery, she developed gangrene, and doctors amputated her forearm.  Levine brought a state-law damages action, alleging, inter alia, that Wyeth had failed to provide an adequate warning about the significant risks of administering Phenergan by the IV-push method.  The Vermont jury determined that Levine\u2019s injury would not have occurred if Phenergan\u2019s label included an adequate warning, and it awarded damages for her pain and suffering, substantial medical expenses, and loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.  Declining to overturn the verdict, the trial court rejected Wyeth\u2019s argument that Levine\u2019s failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law because Phenergan\u2019s labeling had been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  \nHeld:\u00a0Federal law does not pre-empt Levine\u2019s claim that Phenergan\u2019s label did not contain an adequate warning about the IV-push method of administration.  Pp.\u00a06\u201325.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The argument that Levine\u2019s state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for Wyeth to comply with both the state-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties is rejected.  Although a manufacturer generally may change a drug label only after the FDA approves a supplemental application, the agency\u2019s \u201cchanges being effected\u201d (CBE) regulation permits certain preapproval labeling changes that add or strengthen a warning to improve drug safety.  Pursuant to the CBE regulation, Wyeth could have unilaterally added a stronger warning about IV-push administration, and there is no evidence that the FDA would ultimately have rejected such a labeling change.  Wyeth\u2019s cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad assertion that unilaterally changing the Phenergan label would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution and misbranding of drugs are based on the fundamental misunderstanding that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling.  It is a central premise of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDA\u2019s regulations that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.  Pp.\u00a011\u201316. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Wyeth\u2019s argument that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress\u2019 purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is meritless because it relies on an untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency\u2019s power to pre-empt state law.  The history of the FDCA shows that Congress did not intend to pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.  In advancing the argument that the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten the FDA\u2019s statutorily prescribed role.  Although an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements, this case involves no such regulation but merely an agency\u2019s assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Where, as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state law directly, the weight this Court accords the agency\u2019s explanation of state law\u2019s impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf., e.g., Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134.  Under this standard, the FDA\u2019s 2006 preamble does not merit deference: It is inherently suspect in light of the FDA\u2019s failure to offer interested parties notice or opportunity for comment on the pre-emption question; it is at odds with the available evidence of Congress\u2019 purposes; and it reverses the FDA\u2019s own longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of drug regulation without providing a reasoned explanation.

The warnings on Phenergan\u2019s label had been deemed sufficient by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it approved Wyeth\u2019s new drug application in 1955 and when it later approved changes in the drug\u2019s labeling.  The question we must decide is whether the FDA\u2019s approvals provide Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine\u2019s tort claims.  We conclude that they do not.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Phenergan is Wyeth\u2019s brand name for promethazine hydrochloride, an antihistamine used to treat nausea.  The injectable form of Phenergan can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and it can be administered intravenously through either the \u201cIV-push\u201d method, whereby the drug is injected directly into a patient\u2019s vein, or the \u201cIV-drip\u201d method, whereby the drug is introduced into a saline solution in a hanging intravenous bag and slowly descends through a catheter inserted in a patient\u2019s vein.  The drug is corrosive and causes irreversible gangrene if it enters a patient\u2019s artery.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levine\u2019s injury resulted from an IV-push injection of Phenergan.  On April 7, 2000, as on previous visits to her local clinic for treatment of a migraine headache, she received an intramuscular injection of Demerol for her headache and Phenergan for her nausea.  Because the combination did not provide relief, she returned later that day and received a second injection of both drugs.  This time, the physician assistant administered the drugs by the IV-push method, and Phenergan entered Levine\u2019s artery, either because the needle penetrated an artery directly or because the drug escaped from the vein into surrounding tissue (a phenomenon called \u201cperivascular extravasation\u201d) where it came in contact with arterial blood.  As a result, Levine developed gangrene, and doctors amputated first her right hand and then her entire forearm.  In addition to her pain and suffering, Levine incurred substantial medical expenses and the loss of her livelihood as a professional musician.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After settling claims against the health center and clinician, Levine brought an action for damages against Wyeth, relying on common-law negligence and strict-liability theories.  Although Phenergan\u2019s labeling warned of the danger of gangrene and amputation following inadvertent intra-arterial injection,[Footnote 1] Levine alleged that the labeling was defective because it failed to instruct clinicians to use the IV-drip method of intravenous administration instead of the higher risk IV-push method.  More broadly, she alleged that Phenergan is not reasonably safe for intravenous administration because the foreseeable risks of gangrene and loss of limb are great in relation to the drug\u2019s therapeutic benefits.  App. 14\u201315.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Levine\u2019s failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted by federal law.  The court found no merit in either Wyeth\u2019s field pre-emption argument, which it has since abandoned, or its conflict pre-emption argument.  With respect to the contention that there was an \u201cactual conflict between a specific FDA order,\u201d id., at 21, and Levine\u2019s failure-to-warn action, the court reviewed the sparse correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA about Phenergan\u2019s labeling and found no evidence that Wyeth had \u201cearnestly attempted\u201d to strengthen the intra-arterial injection warning or that the FDA had \u201cspecifically disallowed\u201d stronger language, id., at 23.  The record, as then developed, \u201clack[ed] any evidence that the FDA set a ceiling on this matter.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The evidence presented during the 5-day jury trial showed that the risk of intra-arterial injection or perivascular extravasation can be almost entirely eliminated through the use of IV-drip, rather than IV-push, administration.  An IV drip is started with saline, which will not flow properly if the catheter is not in the vein and fluid is entering an artery or surrounding tissue.  See id., at 50\u201351, 60, 66\u201368, 75.  By contrast, even a careful and experienced clinician using the IV-push method will occasionally expose an artery to Phenergan.  See id., at 73, 75\u201376.  While Phenergan\u2019s labeling warned against intra-arterial injection and perivascular extravasation and advised that \u201c[w]hen administering any irritant drug intravenously it is usually preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be function-\ning satisfactorily,\u201d id., at 390, the labeling did not con-\ntain a specific warning about the risks of IV-push\nadministration.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial record also contains correspondence between Wyeth and the FDA discussing Phenergan\u2019s label.  The FDA first approved injectable Phenergan in 1955.  In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the agency approved after proposing labeling changes.  Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels.  Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan\u2019s label.  The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes.  The FDA did not respond.  Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth\u2019s 1988 submission, instructed it to \u201c[r]etain verbiage in current label\u201d regarding intra-arterial injection.  Id., at 359.  After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA approved Wyeth\u2019s 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan\u2019s final printed label \u201cmust be identical\u201d to the approved package insert.  Id., at 382.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on this regulatory history, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider evidence of Wyeth\u2019s compliance with FDA requirements but that such compliance did not establish that the warnings were adequate.  He also instructed, without objection from Wyeth, that FDA regulations \u201cpermit a drug manufacturer to change a product label to add or strengthen a warning about its product without prior FDA approval so long as it later submits the revised warning for review and approval.\u201d  Id., at 228.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answering questions on a special verdict form, the jury found that Wyeth was negligent, that Phenergan was a defective product as a result of inadequate warnings and instructions, and that no intervening cause had broken the causal connection between the product defects and the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Id., at 233\u2013235.  It awarded total damages of $7,400,000, which the court reduced to account for Levine\u2019s earlier settlement with the health center and clinician.  Id., at 235\u2013236.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 3, 2004, the trial court filed a comprehensive opinion denying Wyeth\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.  After making findings of fact based on the trial record (supplemented by one letter that Wyeth found after the trial), the court rejected Wyeth\u2019s pre-emption arguments.  It determined that there was no direct conflict between FDA regulations and Levine\u2019s state-law claims because those regulations permit strengthened warnings without FDA approval on an interim basis and the record contained evidence of at least 20 reports of amputations similar to Levine\u2019s since the 1960\u2019s.  The court also found that state tort liability in this case would not obstruct the FDA\u2019s work because the agency had paid no more than passing attention to the question whether to warn against IV-push administration of Phenergan.  In addition, the court noted that state law serves a compensatory function distinct from federal regulation.  Id., at 249\u2013252.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.  It held that the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cdid not conflict with FDA\u2019s labeling requirements for Phenergan because [Wyeth] could have warned against IV-push administration without prior FDA approval, and because federal labeling requirements create a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation.\u201d  ___ Vt. ___, ___ 944 A.\u00a02d 179, 184 (2006).  In dissent, Chief Justice Reiber argued that the jury\u2019s verdict conflicted with federal law because it was inconsistent with the FDA\u2019s conclusion that intravenous administration of Phenergan was safe and effective.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of the pre-emption issue, coupled with the fact that the FDA has changed its position on state tort law and now endorses the views expressed in Chief Justice Reiber\u2019s dissent, persuaded us to grant Wyeth\u2019s petition for certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).  The question presented by the petition is whether the FDA\u2019s drug labeling judgments \u201cpreempt state law product liability claims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were necessary to make drugs reasonably safe for use.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. i.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth makes two separate pre-emption arguments: first, that it would have been impossible for it to comply with the state-law duty to modify Phenergan\u2019s labeling without violating federal law, see Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982), and second, that recognition of Levine\u2019s state tort action creates an unacceptable \u201cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury\u2019s decision about drug labeling for the expert judgment of the FDA.  As a preface to our evaluation of these arguments, we identify two factual propositions decided during the trial court proceedings, emphasize two legal principles that guide our analysis, and review the history of the controlling federal statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court proceedings established that Levine\u2019s injury would not have occurred if Phenergan\u2019s label had included an adequate warning about the risks of the IV-push method of administering the drug.  The record contains evidence that the physician assistant administered a greater dose than the label prescribed, that she may have inadvertently injected the drug into an artery rather than a vein, and that she continued to inject the drug after Levine complained of pain.  Nevertheless, the jury rejected Wyeth\u2019s argument that the clinician\u2019s conduct was an intervening cause that absolved it of liability.  See App. 234 (jury verdict), 252\u2013254.  In finding Wyeth negligent as well as strictly liable, the jury also determined that Levine\u2019s injury was foreseeable.  That the inadequate label was both a but-for and proximate cause of Levine\u2019s injury is supported by the record and no longer challenged by Wyeth.[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court proceedings further established that the critical defect in Phenergan\u2019s label was the lack of an adequate warning about the risks of IV-push administration.  Levine also offered evidence that the IV-push method should be contraindicated and that Phenergan should never be administered intravenously, even by the IV-drip method.  Perhaps for this reason, the dissent incorrectly assumes that the state-law duty at issue is the duty to contraindicate the IV-push method.  See, e.g., post, at 8, 25.  But, as the Vermont Supreme Court explained, the jury verdict established only that Phenergan\u2019s warning was insufficient.  It did not mandate a particular replacement warning, nor did it require contraindicating IV-push administration: \u201cThere may have been any number of ways for [Wyeth] to strengthen the Phenergan warning without completely eliminating IV-push administration.\u201d  ___ Vt., at ___, n.\u00a02, 944 A.\u00a02d, at 189, n.\u00a02.  We therefore need not decide whether a state rule proscribing intravenous administration would be pre-empted.  The narrower question presented is whether federal law pre-empts Levine\u2019s claim that Phenergan\u2019s label did not contain an adequate warning about using the IV-push method of administration.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our answer to that question must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence.  First, \u201cthe purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963).  Second, \u201c[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has \u2018legislated \u2026 in a field which the States have traditionally occupied,\u2019 \u2026 we \u2018start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)).[Footnote 3]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to identify the \u201cpurpose of Congress,\u201d it is appropriate to briefly review the history of federal regulation of drugs and drug labeling.  In 1906, Congress enacted its first significant public health law, the Federal Food and Drugs Act, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768.  The Act, which prohibited the manufacture or interstate shipment of adulterated or misbranded drugs, supplemented the protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and common-law liability.  In the 1930\u2019s, Congress became increasingly concerned about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7301 et seq.  The Act\u2019s most substantial innovation was its provision for premarket approval of new drugs.  It required every manufacturer to submit a new drug application, including reports of investigations and specimens of proposed labeling, to the FDA for review.  Until its application became effective, a manufacturer was prohibited from distributing a drug.  The FDA could reject an application if it determined that the drug was not safe for use as labeled, though if the agency failed to act, an application became effective 60 days after the filing.   FDCA, \u00a7505(c), 52 Stat. 1052.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA and shifted the burden of proof from the FDA to the manufacturer.  Before 1962, the agency had to prove harm to keep a drug out of the market, but the amendments required the manufacturer to demonstrate that its drug was \u201csafe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling\u201d before it could distribute the drug.  \u00a7\u00a7102(d), 104(b), 76 Stat. 781, 784.  In addition, the amendments required the manufacturer to prove the drug\u2019s effectiveness by introducing \u201csubstantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.\u201d  \u00a7102(d), id., at 781.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it enlarged the FDA\u2019s powers to \u201cprotect the public health\u201d and \u201cassure the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,\u201d id., at 780, Congress took care to preserve state law.  The 1962 amendments added a saving clause, indicating that a provision of state law would only be invalidated upon a \u201cdirect and positive conflict\u201d with the FDCA.  \u00a7202, id., at 793.  Consistent with that provision, state common-law suits \u201ccontinued unabated despite \u2026 FDA regulation.\u201d  Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 8) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see ibid., n.\u00a011 (collecting state cases).  And when Congress enacted an express pre-emption provision for medical devices in 1976, see \u00a7521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a)), it declined to enact such a provision for prescription drugs.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2007, after Levine\u2019s injury and lawsuit, Congress again amended the FDCA.  121 Stat. 823.  For the first time, it granted the FDA statutory authority to require a manufacturer to change its drug label based on safety information that becomes available after a drug\u2019s initial approval.  \u00a7901(a), id., at 924\u2013926.  In doing so, however, Congress did not enact a provision in the Senate bill that would have required the FDA to preapprove all changes to drug labels.  See S.\u00a01082, 110th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7208, pp.\u00a0107\u2013114 (2007) (as passed) (proposing new \u00a7506D).  Instead, it adopted a rule of construction to make it clear that manufacturers remain responsible for updating their labels.  See 121 Stat. 925\u2013926.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth first argues that Levine\u2019s state-law claims are pre-empted because it is impossible for it to comply with both the state-law duties underlying those claims and its federal labeling duties.  See De la Cuesta, 458 U. S., at 153.  The FDA\u2019s premarket approval of a new drug application includes the approval of the exact text in the proposed label.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7355; 21 CFR \u00a7314.105(b) (2008).  Generally speaking, a manufacturer may only change a drug label after the FDA approves a supplemental application.  There is, however, an FDA regulation that permits a manufacturer to make certain changes to its label before receiving the agency\u2019s approval.  Among other things, this \u201cchanges being effected\u201d (CBE) regulation provides that if a manufacturer is changing a label to \u201cadd or strengthen a contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction\u201d or to \u201cadd or strengthen an instruction about dosage and administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product,\u201d it may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application with the FDA; it need not wait for FDA approval.  \u00a7\u00a7314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth argues that the CBE regulation is not implicated in this case because a 2008 amendment provides that a manufacturer may only change its label \u201cto reflect newly acquired information.\u201d  73 Fed. Reg. 49609.  Resting on this language (which Wyeth argues simply reaffirmed the interpretation of the regulation in effect when this case was tried), Wyeth contends that it could have changed Phenergan\u2019s label only in response to new information that the FDA had not considered.  And it maintains that Levine has not pointed to any such information concerning the risks of IV-push administration.  Thus, Wyeth insists, it was impossible for it to discharge its state-law obligation to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration without violating federal law.  Wyeth\u2019s argument misapprehends both the federal drug regulatory scheme and its burden in establishing a pre-emption defense.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not decide whether the 2008 CBE regulation is consistent with the FDCA and the previous version of the regulation, as Wyeth and the United States urge, because Wyeth could have revised Phenergan\u2019s label even in accordance with the amended regulation.  As the FDA explained in its notice of the final rule, \u201c\u00a0\u2018newly acquired information\u2019\u00a0\u201d is not limited to new data, but also encompasses \u201cnew analyses of previously submitted data.\u201d  Id., at 49604.  The rule accounts for the fact that risk information accumulates over time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in light of subsequent developments: \u201c[I]f the sponsor submits adverse event information to FDA, and then later conducts a new analysis of data showing risks of a different type or of greater severity or frequency than did reports previously submitted to FDA, the sponsor meets the requirement for \u2018newly acquired information.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 49607; see also id., at 49606.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The record is limited concerning what newly acquired information Wyeth had or should have had about the risks of IV-push administration of Phenergan because Wyeth did not argue before the trial court that such information was required for a CBE labeling change.  Levine did, however, present evidence of at least 20 incidents prior to her injury in which a Phenergan injection resulted in gangrene and an amputation.  See App. 74, 252.[Footnote 4]  After the first such incident came to Wyeth\u2019s attention in 1967, it notified the FDA and worked with the agency to change Phenergan\u2019s label.  In later years, as amputations continued to occur, Wyeth could have analyzed the accumulating data and added a stronger warning about IV-push administration of the drug.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth argues that if it had unilaterally added such a warning, it would have violated federal law governing unauthorized distribution and misbranding.  Its argument that a change in Phenergan\u2019s labeling would have subjected it to liability for unauthorized distribution rests on the assumption that this labeling change would have rendered Phenergan a new drug lacking an effective application.  But strengthening the warning about IV-push administration would not have made Phenergan a new drug.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7321(p)(1) (defining \u201cnew drug\u201d); 21 CFR \u00a7310.3(h).  Nor would this warning have rendered Phenergan misbranded.  The FDCA does not provide that a drug is misbranded simply because the manufacturer has altered an FDA-approved label; instead, the misbranding provision focuses on the substance of the label and, among other things, proscribes labels that fail to include \u201cadequate warnings.\u201d  21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7352(f).  Moreover, because the statute contemplates that federal juries will resolve most misbranding claims, the FDA\u2019s belief that a drug is misbranded is not conclusive.  See \u00a7\u00a7331, 332, 334(a)\u2013(b).  And the very idea that the FDA would bring an enforcement action against a manufacturer for strengthening a warning pursuant to the CBE regulation is difficult to accept\u2014neither Wyeth nor the United States has identified a case in which the FDA has done so.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth\u2019s cramped reading of the CBE regulation and its broad reading of the FDCA\u2019s misbranding and unauthorized distribution provisions are premised on a more fundamental misunderstanding.  Wyeth suggests that the FDA, rather than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug labeling.  Yet through many amendments to the FDCA and to FDA regulations, it has remained a central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility for the content of its label at all times.  It is charged both with crafting an adequate label and with ensuring that its warnings remain adequate as long as the drug is on the market.  See, e.g., 21 CFR \u00a7201.80(e) (requiring a manufacturer to revise its label \u201cto include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug\u201d); \u00a7314.80(b) (placing responsibility for postmarketing surveillance on the manufacturer); 73 Fed. Reg. 49605 (\u201cManufacturers continue to have a responsibility under Federal law \u2026 to maintain their labeling and update the labeling with new safety information\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, prior to 2007, the FDA lacked the authority to order manufacturers to revise their labels.  See 121 Stat. 924\u2013926.  When Congress granted the FDA this authority, it reaffirmed the manufacturer\u2019s obligations and referred specifically to the CBE regulation, which both reflects the manufacturer\u2019s ultimate responsibility for its label and provides a mechanism for adding safety information to the label prior to FDA approval.  See id., at 925\u2013926 (stating that a manufacturer retains the responsibility \u201cto maintain its label in accordance with existing requirements, including subpart B of part 201 and sections 314.70 and 601.12 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations)\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, when the risk of gangrene from IV-push injection of Phenergan became apparent, Wyeth had a duty to provide a warning that adequately described that risk, and the CBE regulation permitted it to provide such a warning before receiving the FDA\u2019s approval.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the FDA retains authority to reject labeling changes made pursuant to the CBE regulation in its review of the manufacturer\u2019s supplemental application, just as it retains such authority in reviewing all supplemental applications.  But absent clear evidence that the FDA would not have approved a change to Phenergan\u2019s label, we will not conclude that it was impossible for Wyeth to comply with both federal and state requirements. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth has offered no such evidence.  It does not argue that it attempted to give the kind of warning required by the Vermont jury but was prohibited from doing so by the FDA.[Footnote 5]  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.  And while it does suggest that the FDA intended to prohibit it from strengthening the warning about IV-push administration because the agency deemed such a warning inappropriate in reviewing Phenergan\u2019s drug applications, both the trial court and the Vermont Supreme Court rejected this account as a matter of fact.  In its decision on Wyeth\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial court found \u201cno evidence in this record that either the FDA or the manufacturer gave more than passing attention to the issue of\u201d IV-push versus IV-drip administration.  App. 249.  The Vermont Supreme Court likewise concluded that the FDA had not made an affirmative decision to preserve the IV-push method or intended to prohibit Wyeth from strengthening its warning about IV-push administration.  ___ Vt., at ___, 944 A.\u00a02d, at 188\u2013189.  Moreover, Wyeth does not argue that it supplied the FDA with an evaluation or analysis concerning the specific dangers posed by the IV-push method.  We accordingly cannot credit Wyeth\u2019s contention that the FDA would have prevented it from adding a stronger warning about the IV-push method of intravenous administration.[Footnote 6] \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impossibility pre-emption is a demanding defense.  On the record before us, Wyeth has failed to demonstrate that it was impossible for it to comply with both federal and state requirements.  The CBE regulation permitted Wyeth to unilaterally strengthen its warning, and the mere fact that the FDA approved Phenergan\u2019s label does not establish that it would have prohibited such a change.  \nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth also argues that requiring it to comply with a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning about IV-push administration would obstruct the purposes and objectives of federal drug labeling regulation.  Levine\u2019s tort claims, it maintains, are pre-empted because they interfere with \u201cCongress\u2019s purpose to entrust an expert agency to make drug labeling decisions that strike a balance between competing objectives.\u201d  Brief for Petitioner 46.  We find no merit in this argument, which relies on an untenable interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency\u2019s power to pre-empt state law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth contends that the FDCA establishes both a floor and a ceiling for drug regulation: Once the FDA has approved a drug\u2019s label, a state-law verdict may not deem the label inadequate, regardless of whether there is any evidence that the FDA has considered the stronger warning at issue.  The most glaring problem with this argument is that all evidence of Congress\u2019 purposes is to the contrary.  Building on its 1906 Act, Congress enacted the FDCA to bolster consumer protection against harmful products.  See Kordel v. United States, 335 U. S. 345, 349 (1948); United States v. Sullivan, 332 U. S. 689, 696 (1948).  Congress did not provide a federal remedy for consumers harmed by unsafe or ineffective drugs in the 1938 statute or in any subsequent amendment.  Evidently, it determined that widely available state rights of action provided appropriate relief for injured consumers.[Footnote 7]  It may also have recognized that state-law remedies further consumer protection by motivating manufacturers to produce safe and effective drugs and to give adequate warnings.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express pre-emption provision at some point during the FDCA\u2019s 70-year history.  But despite its 1976 enactment of an express pre-emption provision for medical devices, see \u00a7521, 90 Stat. 574 (codified at 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a)), Congress has not enacted such a provision for prescription drugs. See Riegel, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (\u201cCongress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA.  It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices\u201d).[Footnote 8]  Its silence on the issue, coupled with its certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation, is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.  As Justice O\u2019Connor explained in her opinion for a unanimous Court: \u201cThe case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.\u201d  Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166\u2013167 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also supra, at 8 (discussing the presumption against pre-emption).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite this evidence that Congress did not regard state tort litigation as an obstacle to achieving its purposes, Wyeth nonetheless maintains that, because the FDCA requires the FDA to determine that a drug is safe and effective under the conditions set forth in its labeling, the agency must be presumed to have performed a precise balancing of risks and benefits and to have established a specific labeling standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments.  In advancing this argument, Wyeth relies not on any statement by Congress, but instead on the preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation governing the content and format of prescription drug labels.  See Brief for Petitioner 8, 11, 42, 45, and 50 (citing 71 Fed. Reg. 3922 (2006)).  In that preamble, the FDA declared that the FDCA establishes \u201cboth a \u2018floor\u2019 and a \u2018ceiling,\u2019\u00a0\u201d so that \u201cFDA approval of labeling \u2026 preempts conflicting or contrary State law.\u201d  Id., at 3934\u20133935.  It further stated that certain state-law actions, such as those involving failure-to-warn claims, \u201cthreaten FDA\u2019s statutorily prescribed role as the expert Federal agency responsible for evaluating and regulating drugs.\u201d  Id., at 3935.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has recognized that an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements.  See, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000); Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 713 (1985).  In such cases, the Court has performed its own conflict determination, relying on the substance of state and federal law and not on agency proclamations of pre-emption.  We are faced with no such regulation in this case, but rather with an agency\u2019s mere assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Because Congress has not authorized the FDA to pre-empt state law directly, cf. 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k (authorizing the FDA to determine the scope of the Medical Devices Amendments\u2019 pre-emption clause),[Footnote 9] the question is what weight we should accord the FDA\u2019s opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In prior cases, we have given \u201csome weight\u201d to an agency\u2019s views about the impact of tort law on federal objectives when \u201cthe subject matter is technica[l] and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.\u201d  Geier, 529 U. S., at 883.  Even in such cases, however, we have not deferred to an agency\u2019s conclusion that state law is pre-empted.  Rather, we have attended to an agency\u2019s explanation of how state law affects the regulatory scheme.  While agencies have no special authority to pronounce on pre-emption absent delegation by Congress, they do have a unique understanding of the statutes they administer and an attendant ability to make informed determinations about how state requirements may pose an \u201cobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d  Hines, 312 U.S, at 67; see Geier, 529 U. S., at 883; Lohr, 518 U. S., at 495\u2013496.  The weight we accord the agency\u2019s explanation of state law\u2019s impact on the federal scheme depends on its thoroughness, consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 234\u2013235 (2001); Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under this standard, the FDA\u2019s 2006 preamble does not merit deference.  When the FDA issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in December 2000, it explained that the rule would \u201cnot contain policies that have federalism implications or that preempt State law.\u201d  65 Fed. Reg. 81103; see also 71 id., at 3969 (noting that the \u201cproposed rule did not propose to preempt state law\u201d).  In 2006, the agency finalized the rule and, without offering States or other interested parties notice or opportunity for comment, articulated a sweeping position on the FDCA\u2019s pre-emptive effect in the regulatory preamble.  The agency\u2019s views on state law are inherently suspect in light of this procedural failure.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the preamble is at odds with what evidence we have of Congress\u2019 purposes, and it reverses the FDA\u2019s own longstanding position without providing a reasoned explanation, including any discussion of how state law has interfered with the FDA\u2019s regulation of drug labeling during decades of coexistence.  The FDA\u2019s 2006 position plainly does not reflect the agency\u2019s own view at all times relevant to this litigation.  Not once prior to Levine\u2019s injury did the FDA suggest that state tort law stood as an obstacle to its statutory mission.  To the contrary, it cast federal labeling standards as a floor upon which States could build and repeatedly disclaimed any attempt to pre-empt failure-to-warn claims.  For instance, in 1998, the FDA stated that it did \u201cnot believe that the evolution of state tort law [would] cause the development of standards that would be at odds with the agency\u2019s regulations.\u201d  63 id., at 66384.  It further noted that, in establishing \u201cminimal standards\u201d for drug labels, it did not intend \u201cto preclude the states from imposing additional labeling requirements.\u201d  Ibid.[Footnote 10]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In keeping with Congress\u2019 decision not to pre-empt common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation.  The FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market,[Footnote 11] and manufacturers have superior access to information about their drugs, especially in the postmarketing phase as new risks emerge.  State tort suits uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly.  They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with information.  Failure-to-warn actions, in particular, lend force to the FDCA\u2019s premise that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear primary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times.  Thus, the FDA long maintained that state law offers an additional, and important, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation.[Footnote 12]  The agency\u2019s 2006 preamble represents a dramatic change in position.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Largely based on the FDA\u2019s new position, Wyeth argues that this case presents a conflict between state and federal law analogous to the one at issue in Geier.  There, we held that state tort claims premised on Honda\u2019s failure to install airbags conflicted with a federal regulation that did not require airbags for all cars.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) had promulgated a rule that provided car manufacturers with a range of choices among passive restraint devices.  Geier, 529 U. S., at 875.  Rejecting an \u201c\u00a0\u2018all airbag\u2019\u00a0\u201d standard, the agency had called for a gradual phase-in of a mix of passive restraints in order to spur technological development and win consumer acceptance.  Id., at 879.  Because the plaintiff\u2019s claim was that car manufacturers had a duty to install airbags, it presented an obstacle to achieving \u201cthe variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought.\u201d  Id., at 881.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wyeth and the dissent contend that the regulatory scheme in this case is nearly identical, but, as we have described, it is quite different.  In Geier, the DOT conducted a formal rulemaking and then adopted a plan to phase in a mix of passive restraint devices.  Examining the rule itself and the DOT\u2019s contemporaneous record, which revealed the factors the agency had weighed and the balance it had struck, we determined that state tort suits presented an obstacle to the federal scheme.  After conducting our own pre-emption analysis, we considered the agency\u2019s explanation of how state law interfered with its regulation, regarding it as further support for our independent conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s tort claim obstructed the federal regime.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, we have no occasion in this case to consider the pre-emptive effect of a specific agency regulation bearing the force of law.  And the FDA\u2019s newfound opinion, expressed in its 2006 preamble, that state law \u201cfrustrate[s] the agency\u2019s implementation of its statutory mandate,\u201d 71 Fed. Reg. 3934, does not merit deference for the reasons we have explained.[Footnote 13]  Indeed, the \u201ccomplex and extensive\u201d regulatory history and background relevant to this case, Geier, 529 U. S., at 883, undercut the FDA\u2019s recent pronouncements of pre-emption, as they reveal the longstanding coexistence of state and federal law and the FDA\u2019s traditional recognition of state-law remedies\u2014a recognition in place each time the agency reviewed Wyeth\u2019s Phenergan label.[Footnote 14]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, Wyeth has not persuaded us that failure-to-warn claims like Levine\u2019s obstruct the federal regulation of drug labeling.  Congress has repeatedly declined to pre-empt state law, and the FDA\u2019s recently adopted position that state tort suits interfere with its statutory mandate is entitled to no weight.  Although we recognize that some state-law claims might well frustrate the achievement of congressional objectives, this is not such a case.\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that it is not impossible for Wyeth to comply with its state and federal law obligations and that Levine\u2019s common-law claims do not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress\u2019 purposes in the FDCA. Accordingly, the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0The warning for \u201cInadvertent Intra-arterial Injection\u201d stated: \u201cDue to the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most commonly used for intravenous injection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid perivascular extravasation or inadvertent intra-arterial injection.  Reports compatible with inadvertent intra-arterial injection of Phenergan Injection, usually in conjunction with other drugs intended for intravenous use, suggest that pain, severe chemical irritation, severe spasm of distal vessels, and resultant gangrene requiring amputation are likely under such circumstances.  Intravenous injection was intended in all the cases reported but perivascular extravasation or arterial placement of the needle is now suspect.  There is no proven successful management of this condition after it occurs. . . . Aspiration of dark blood does not preclude intra-arterial needle placement, because blood is discolored upon contact with Phenergan Injection.  Use of syringes with rigid plungers or of small bore needles might obscure typical arterial backflow if this is relied upon alone.  When used intravenously, Phenergan Injection should be given in a concentration no greater than 25 mg per mL and at a rate not to exceed 25 mg per minute.  When administering any irritant drug intravenously, it is usually preferable to inject it through the tubing of an intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning satisfactorily.  In the event that a patient complains of pain during intended intravenous injection of Phenergan Injection, the injection should be stopped immediately to provide for evaluation of possible arterial placement or perivascular extravasation.\u201d  App. 390.\n\u00a0The dissent nonetheless suggests that physician malpractice was the exclusive cause of Levine\u2019s injury.  See, e.g., post, at 1 (opinion of Alito, J.) (\u201c[I]t is unclear how a \u2018stronger\u2019 warning could have helped respondent\u201d); post, at 16\u201318 (suggesting that the physician assistant\u2019s conduct was the sole cause of the injury).  The dissent\u2019s frustration with the jury\u2019s verdict does not put the merits of Levine\u2019s tort claim before us, nor does it change the question we must decide\u2014whether federal law pre-empts Levine\u2019s state-law claims.\n\u00a0Wyeth argues that the presumption against pre-emption should not apply to this case because the Federal Government has regulated drug labeling for more than a century.  That argument misunderstands the principle: We rely on the presumption because respect for the States as \u201cindependent sovereigns in our federal system\u201d leads us to assume that \u201cCongress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996).  The presumption thus accounts for the historic presence of state law but does not rely on the absence of federal regulation. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For its part, the dissent argues that the presumption against pre-emption should not apply to claims of implied conflict pre-emption at all, post, at 21, but this Court has long held to the contrary.  See, e.g., California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U. S. 93, 101\u2013102 (1989); Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 716 (1985); see also Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 387 (2002).  The dissent\u2019s reliance on Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001), see post, at 21, and n.\u00a014, is especially curious, as that case involved state-law fraud-on-the-agency claims, and the Court distinguished state regulation of health and safety as matters to which the presumption does apply.  See 531 U. S., at 347\u2013348.\n\u00a0Levine also introduced evidence that Pfizer had withdrawn Vistaril, another antinausea drug, from intravenous use several decades earlier because its intravenous injection had resulted in gangrene and amputations.  See App. 79.\n\u00a0The record would not, in any event, support such an argument.  In 1988, Wyeth did propose different language for Phenergan\u2019s warning about intra-arterial injection, adapted from revisions the FDA proposed in 1987.  See App. 339\u2013341, 311\u2013312.  When the FDA approved Wyeth\u2019s application, it instructed Wyeth to retain the wording in its current label.  During the trial court proceedings, Levine indicated that the language proposed in 1988 would have more strongly warned against IV-push administration.  But the trial court and the Vermont Supreme Court found that the 1988 warning did not differ in any material respect from the FDA-approved warning.  See ___ Vt. ___, ___, 944 A.\u00a02d 179, 189 (2006) (\u201cSimply stated, the proposed warning was different, but not stronger.  It was also no longer or more prominent than the original warning \u2026\u201d); App. 248\u2013250.  Indeed, the United States concedes that the FDA did not regard the proposed warning as substantively different: \u201c[I]t appears the FDA viewed the change as non-substantive and rejected it for formatting reasons.\u201d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25; see also ___ Vt., at ___, 944 A.\u00a02d, at 189.\n\u00a0The dissent\u2019s suggestion that the FDA intended to prohibit Wyeth from strengthening its warning does not fairly reflect the record.  The dissent creatively paraphrases a few FDA orders\u2014for instance by conflating warnings about IV-push administration and intra-arterial injection, see, e.g., post, at 9, 11\u201312, 15\u201316\u2014to suggest greater agency attention to the question, and it undertakes a study of Phenergan\u2019s labeling that is more elaborate than any FDA order.  But even the dissent\u2019s account does not support the conclusion that the FDA would have prohibited Wyeth from adding a stronger warning pursuant to the CBE regulation.\n\u00a0Although the first version of the bill that became the FDCA would have provided a federal cause of action for damages for injured consumers, see H.\u00a0R. 6110, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a725 (1933) (as introduced), witnesses testified that such a right of action was unnecessary because common-law claims were already available under state law.  See Hearings on S.\u00a01944 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 400 (1933) (statement of W. A. Hines); see id., at 403 (statement of J. A. Ladds) (\u201cThis act should not attempt to modify or restate the common law with respect to personal injuries\u201d).\n\u00a0In 1997, Congress pre-empted certain state requirements concerning over-the-counter medications and cosmetics but expressly preserved product liability actions.  See 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7379r(e), 379s(d) (\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect any action or the liability of any person under the product liability law of any State\u201d).\n\u00a0For similar examples, see 47 U.

Unlike the Government\u2019s brief in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), which explained the effects of state law on the DOT\u2019s regulation in a manner consistent with the agency\u2019s prior accounts, see id., at 861, the Government\u2019s explanation of federal drug regulation departs markedly from the FDA\u2019s understanding at all times relevant to this case. \n\u00a0Wyeth\u2019s more specific contention\u2014that this case resembles Geier because the FDA determined that no additional warning on IV-push administration was needed, thereby setting a ceiling on Phenergan\u2019s label\u2014is belied by the record.  As we have discussed, the FDA did not consider and reject a stronger warning against IV-push injection of Phenergan.

In seeking certiorari, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard argued that the Arizona Supreme Court's ruling conflicted with the Court's precedent, as well as precedents set forth in various federal and state courts.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is a search conducted by police officers after handcuffing the defendant and securing the scene a violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes, under the circumstances of this case. The Supreme Court held that police may search the vehicle of its recent occupant after his arrest only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of the arrest. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court reasoned that \"warrantless searches are per se unreasonable\" and subject only to a few, very narrow exceptions. Here, Mr. Gant was arrested for a suspended license and the narrow exceptions did not apply to his case.</p>\n<p>Justice Scalia wrote separately, concurring. Justice Samuel A. Alito dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer. He argued that the majority improperly overruled its precedent in <em>New York v. Belton</em> which held that \"when a policeman has made a lawful arrest\u2026 he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer also wrote a separate dissenting opinion, where he lamented that the court could not create a new governing rule.</p>\n<p><em>Learn more about the Roberts Court and the Fourth Amendment in <a href=\"http://projects.oyez.org/shifting-scales/\">Shifting Scales</a>, a nonpartisan Oyez resource.</em></p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 31664, "name": "Joseph T.

RODNEY JOSEPH GANT\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\narizona\n[April 21, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Scalia, concurring.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To determine what is an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, we look first to the historical practices the Framers sought to preserve; if those provide inadequate guidance, we apply traditional standards of reasonableness.  See Virginia v. Moore, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 3\u20136).  Since the historical scope of officers\u2019 authority to search vehicles incident to arrest is uncertain, see Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 629\u2013631 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), traditional standards of reasonableness govern.  It is abundantly clear that those standards do not justify what I take to be the rule set forth in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), and Thornton: that arresting officers may always search an arrestee\u2019s vehicle in order to protect themselves from hidden weapons.  When an arrest is made in connection with a roadside stop, police virtually always have a less intrusive and more effective means of ensuring their safety\u2014and a means that is virtually always employed: ordering the arrestee away from the vehicle, patting him down in the open, handcuffing him, and placing him in the squad car.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Law enforcement officers face a risk of being shot whenever they pull a car over.  But that risk is at its height at the time of the initial confrontation; and it is not at all reduced by allowing a search of the stopped vehicle after the driver has been arrested and placed in the squad car.  I observed in Thornton that the government had failed to provide a single instance in which a formerly restrained arrestee escaped to retrieve a weapon from his own vehicle, 541 U. S., at 626; Arizona and its amici have not remedied that significant deficiency in the present case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be borne in mind that we are speaking here only of a rule automatically permitting a search when the driver or an occupant is arrested. Where no arrest is made, we have held that officers may search the car if they reasonably believe \u201cthe suspect is dangerous and \u2026 may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1049 (1983).  In the no-arrest case, the possibility of access to weapons in the vehicle always exists, since the driver or passenger will be allowed to return to the vehicle when the interrogation is completed.  The rule of Michigan v. Long is not at issue here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens acknowledges that an officer-safety rationale cannot justify all vehicle searches incident to arrest, but asserts that that is not the rule Belton and Thornton adopted.  (As described above, I read those cases differently).  Justice Stevens would therefore retain the application of Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), in the car-search context but would apply in the future what he believes our cases held in the past: that officers making a roadside stop may search the vehicle so long as the \u201carrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.\u201d  Ante, at 18.   I believe that this standard fails to provide the needed guidance to arresting officers and also leaves much room for manipulation, inviting officers to leave the scene unsecured (at least where dangerous suspects are not involved) in order to conduct a vehicle search.  In my view we should simply abandon the Belton-Thornton charade of officer safety and overrule those cases.  I would hold that a vehicle search incident to arrest is ipso facto \u201creasonable\u201d only when the object of the search is evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made, or of another crime that the officer has probable cause to believe occurred.  Because respondent was arrested for driving without a license (a crime for which no evidence could be expected to be found in the vehicle), I would hold in the present case that the search was unlawful.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito insists that the Court must demand a good reason for abandoning prior precedent.  That is true enough, but it seems to me ample reason that the precedent was badly reasoned and produces erroneous (in this case unconstitutional) results.  See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  We should recognize Belton\u2019s fanciful reliance upon officer safety for what it was: \u201ca return to the broader sort of [evidence-gathering] search incident to arrest that we allowed before Chimel.\u201d  Thornton, supra, at 631 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment; citations omitted).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito argues that there is no reason to adopt a rule limiting automobile-arrest searches to those cases where the search\u2019s object is evidence of the crime of arrest.  Post, at 10 (dissenting opinion).  I disagree.  This formulation of officers\u2019 authority both preserves the outcomes of our prior cases and tethers the scope and rationale of the doctrine to the triggering event.  Belton, by contrast, allowed searches precisely when its exigency-based rationale was least applicable: The fact of the arrest in the automobile context makes searches on exigency grounds less reasonable, not more.  I also disagree with Justice Alito\u2019s conclusory assertion that this standard will be difficult to administer in practice, post, at 7; the ease of its application in this case would suggest otherwise.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No other Justice, however, shares my view that application of Chimel in this context should be entirely abandoned.  It seems to me unacceptable for the Court to come forth with a 4-to-1-to-4 opinion that leaves the governing rule uncertain.  I am therefore confronted with the choice of either leaving the current understanding of Belton and Thornton in effect, or acceding to what seems to me the artificial narrowing of those cases adopted by Justice Stevens.  The latter, as I have said, does not provide the degree of certainty I think desirable in this field; but the former opens the field to what I think are plainly unconstitutional searches\u2014which is the greater evil.  I therefore join the opinion of the Court."}, {"id": 1766, "title": "Dissenting opinion", "author": null, "type": {"value": "dissenting", "label": "Dissenting opinion"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962908, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/332/dissent2.html", "judge_full_name": "Samuel A.

RODNEY JOSEPH GANT\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\narizona\n[April 21, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join, and with whom Justice Breyer joins except as to Part II\u2013E, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twenty-eight years ago, in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460 (1981), this Court held that \u201cwhen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Five years ago, in Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615 (2004)\u2014a case involving a situation not materially distinguishable from the situation here\u2014the Court not only reaffirmed but extended the holding of Belton, making it applicable to recent occupants.  Today\u2019s decision effectively overrules those important decisions, even though respondent Gant has not asked us to do so.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take the place of the overruled precedents, the Court adopts a new two-part rule under which a police officer who arrests a vehicle occupant or recent occupant may search the passenger compartment if (1) the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search or (2) the officer has reason to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.  Ante, at 18.  The first part of this new rule may endanger arresting officers and is truly endorsed by only four Justices; Justice Scalia joins solely for the purpose of avoiding a \u201c4-to-1-to 4 opinion.\u201d  Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion).  The second part of the new rule is taken from Justice Scalia\u2019s separate opinion in Thornton without any independent explanation of its origin or justification and is virtually certain to confuse law enforcement officers and judges for some time to come.  The Court\u2019s decision will cause the suppression of evidence gathered in many searches carried out in good-faith reliance on well-settled case law, and although the Court purports to base its analysis on the landmark decision in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), the Court\u2019s reasoning undermines Chimel.  I would follow Belton, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court refuses to acknowledge that it is overruling Belton and Thornton, there can be no doubt that it does so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Belton, an officer on the New York Thruway removed the occupants from a car and placed them under arrest but did not handcuff them.  See 453 U. S., at 456; Brief for Petitioner in New York v. Belton, O.\u00a0T. 1980, No. 80\u2013328, p.\u00a03.  The officer then searched a jacket on the car\u2019s back seat and found drugs.  453 U. S., at 455.  By a divided vote, the New York Court of Appeals held that the search of the jacket violated Chimel, in which this Court held that an arresting officer may search the area within an arrestee\u2019s immediate control.  See State v. Belton, 50 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 447, 407 N.\u00a0E. 2d 420 (1980).  The justices of the New York Court of Appeals disagreed on the factual question whether the Belton arrestees could have gained access to the car.  The majority thought that they could not have done so, id., at 452, n.\u00a02, 407 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 423, n.\u00a02, but the dissent thought that this was a real possibility.  Id., at 453, 407 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 424 (opinion of Gabrielli, J.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewing this disagreement about the application of the Chimel rule as illustrative of a persistent and important problem, the Belton Court concluded that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[a] single familiar standard\u2019\u00a0\u201d was \u201c\u00a0\u2018essential to guide police officers\u2019\u00a0\u201d who make roadside arrests.  453 U. S., at 458 (quoting Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 213\u2013214 (1979)).  The Court acknowledged that articles in the passenger compartment of a car are not always within an arrestee\u2019s reach, but \u201c[i]n order to establish the workable rule this category of cases requires,\u201d the Court adopted a rule that categorically permits the search of a car\u2019s passenger compartment incident to the lawful arrest of an occupant.  453 U. S., at 460.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The precise holding in Belton could not be clearer.  The Court stated unequivocally: \u201c[W]e hold that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\u201d  Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite this explicit statement, the opinion of the Court in the present case curiously suggests that Belton may reasonably be read as adopting a holding that is narrower than the one explicitly set out in the Belton opinion, namely, that an officer arresting a vehicle occupant may search the passenger compartment \u201cwhen the passenger compartment is within an arrestee\u2019s reaching distance.\u201d  Ante, at 7\u20138 (emphasis in original).  According to the  Court, the broader reading of Belton that has gained wide acceptance \u201cmay be attributable to Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent.\u201d  Ante, at 8.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, however, Justice Brennan\u2019s Belton dissent did not mischaracterize the Court\u2019s holding in that case or cause that holding to be misinterpreted.  As noted, the Belton Court explicitly stated precisely what it held.  In Thornton, the Court recognized the scope of Belton\u2019s holding.  See 541 U. S., at 620.  So did Justice Scalia\u2019s separate opinion.  See id., at 625 (opinion concurring in judgment) (\u201cIn [Belton] we set forth a bright-line rule for arrests of automobile occupants, holding that \u2026 a search of the whole [passenger] compartment is justified in every case\u201d).  So does Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in the present case.  See ante, at 1 (Belton and Thornton held that \u201carresting officers may always search an arrestee\u2019s vehicle in order to protect themselves from hidden weapons\u201d).  This \u201cbright-line rule\u201d has now been interred.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court has substantially overruled Belton and Thornton, the Court must explain why its departure from the usual rule of stare decisis is justified.  I recognize that stare decisis is not an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991), and applies less rigidly in constitutional cases, Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion).  But the Court has said that a constitutional precedent should be followed unless there is a \u201c\u00a0\u2018special justification\u2019\u00a0\u201d for its abandonment.  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).  Relevant factors identified in prior cases include whether the precedent has engendered reliance, id., at 442, whether there has been an important change in circumstances in the outside world, Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 244 (2006) (plurality opinion); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), whether the precedent has proved to be unworkable, Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004) (plurality opinion) (citing Payne, supra, at 827), whether the precedent has been undermined by later decisions, see, e.g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173\u2013174 (1989), and whether the decision was badly reasoned.  Vieth, supra, at 306 (plurality opinion).  These factors weigh in favor of retaining the rule established in Belton.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reliance.  While reliance is most important in \u201ccases involving property and contract rights,\u201d Payne, supra, at 828, the Court has recognized that reliance by law enforcement officers is also entitled to weight.  In Dickerson, the Court held that principles of stare decisis \u201cweigh[ed]\u201d heavily against overruling Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), because the Miranda rule had become \u201cembedded in routine police practice.\u201d  530 U. S., at 443.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there was reliance in Dickerson, there certainly is substantial reliance here.  The Belton rule has been taught to police officers for more than a quarter century.  Many searches\u2014almost certainly including more than a few that figure in cases now on appeal\u2014were conducted in scrupulous reliance on that precedent.  It is likely that, on the very day when this opinion is announced, numerous vehicle searches will be conducted in good faith by police officers who were taught the Belton rule.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The opinion of the Court recognizes that \u201cBelton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years.\u201d  Ante, at 16.  But for the Court, this seemingly counts for nothing.  The Court states that \u201c[w]e have never relied on stare decisis to justify the continuance of an unconstitutional police practice,\u201d ante, at 15, but of course the Court routinely relies on decisions sustaining the constitutionality of police practices without doing what the Court has done here\u2014sua sponte considering whether those decisions should be overruled.  And the Court cites no authority for the proposition that stare decisis may be disregarded or provides only lesser protection when the precedent that is challenged is one that sustained the constitutionality of a law enforcement practice.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also errs in arguing that the reliance interest that was given heavy weight in Dickerson was not \u201cpolice reliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right.\u201d  Ante, at 17.  The Dickerson opinion makes no reference to \u201csocietal reliance,\u201d and petitioner in that case contended that there had been reliance on Miranda because, among other things, \u201c[f]or nearly thirty-five years, Miranda\u2019s requirements ha[d] shaped law enforcement training [and] police conduct.\u201d  See Brief for Petitioner in Dickerson v. United States, O.\u00a0T. 1999, No. 99\u20135525, p. 33.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changed circumstances.  Abandonment of the Belton rule cannot be justified on the ground that the dangers surrounding the arrest of a vehicle occupant are different today than they were 28 years ago.  The Court claims that \u201c[w]e now know that articles inside the passenger compartment are rarely \u2018within \u201cthe area into which an arrestee might reach,\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 17\u201318, but surely it was well known in 1981 that a person who is taken from a vehicle, handcuffed, and placed in the back of a patrol car is unlikely to make it back into his own car to retrieve a weapon or destroy evidence.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Workability.  The Belton rule has not proved to be unworkable.  On the contrary, the rule was adopted for the express purpose of providing a test that would be relatively easy for police officers and judges to apply.  The Court correctly notes that even the Belton rule is not perfectly clear in all situations.  Specifically, it is sometimes debatable whether a search is or is not contemporaneous with an arrest, ante, at 6\u20137, but that problem is small in comparison with the problems that the Court\u2019s new two-part rule will produce. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first part of the Court\u2019s new rule\u2014which permits the search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment if it is within an arrestee\u2019s reach at the time of the search\u2014reintroduces the same sort of case-by-case, fact-specific decisionmaking that the Belton rule was adopted to avoid.  As the situation in Belton illustrated, there are cases in which it is unclear whether an arrestee could retrieve a weapon or evidence in the passenger compartment of a car.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even more serious problems will also result from the second part of the Court\u2019s new rule, which requires officers making roadside arrests to determine whether there is reason to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of the crime of arrest.  What this rule permits in a variety of situations is entirely unclear.\nD\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistency with later cases.  The Belton bright-line rule has not been undermined by subsequent cases.  On the contrary, that rule was reaffirmed and extended just five years ago in Thornton.\nE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bad reasoning.  The Court is harshly critical of Belton\u2019s reasoning, but the problem that the Court perceives cannot be remedied simply by overruling Belton.  Belton represented only a modest\u2014and quite defensible\u2014extension of Chimel, as I understand that decision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to Chimel, the Court\u2019s precedents permitted an arresting officer to search the area within an arrestee\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d for the purpose of gathering evidence.  See 395 U. S., at 759\u2013760.  Based on this \u201cabstract doctrine,\u201d id., at 760, n.\u00a04, the Court had sustained searches that extended far beyond an arrestee\u2019s grabbing area.  See United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950) (search of entire office); Harris v. United States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947) (search of entire apartment).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Chimel Court, in an opinion written by Justice Stewart, overruled these cases.  Concluding that there are only two justifications for a warrantless search incident to arrest\u2014officer safety and the preservation of evidence\u2014the Court stated that such a search must be confined to \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s person\u201d and \u201cthe area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d  395 U. S., at 762\u2013763.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, Chimel did not say whether \u201cthe area from within which [an arrestee] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence\u201d is to be measured at the time of the arrest or at the time of the search, but unless the Chimel rule was meant to be a specialty rule, applicable to only a few unusual cases, the Court must have intended for this area to be measured at the time of arrest.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is so because the Court can hardly have failed to appreciate the following two facts.  First, in the great majority of cases, an officer making an arrest is able to handcuff the arrestee and remove him to a secure place before conducting a search incident to the arrest.  See ante, at 10, n.\u00a04 (stating that it is \u201cthe rare case\u201d in which an arresting officer cannot secure an arrestee before conducting a search).  Second, because it is safer for an arresting officer to secure an arrestee before searching, it is likely that this is what arresting officers do in the great majority of cases.  (And it appears, not surprisingly, that this is in fact the prevailing practice.[Footnote 1])  Thus, if the area within an arrestee\u2019s reach were assessed, not at the time of arrest, but at the time of the search, the Chimel rule would  rarely come into play.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, if the applicability of the Chimel rule turned on whether an arresting officer chooses to secure an arrestee prior to conducting a search, rather than searching first and securing the arrestee later, the rule would \u201ccreate a perverse incentive for an arresting officer to prolong the period during which the arrestee is kept in an area where he could pose a danger to the officer.\u201d  United States v. Abdul-Saboor, 85 F.\u00a03d 664, 669 (CADC 1996).  If this is the law, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit observed, \u201cthe law would truly be, as Mr. Bumble said, \u2018a ass.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ibid.  See also United States v. Tejada, 524 F.\u00a03d 809, 812 (CA7 2008) (\u201c[I]f the police could lawfully have searched the defendant\u2019s grabbing radius at the moment of arrest, he has no legitimate complaint if, the better to protect themselves from him, they first put him outside that radius\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not think that this is what the Chimel Court intended.  Handcuffs were in use in 1969.  The ability of arresting officers to secure arrestees before conducting a search\u2014and their incentive to do so\u2014are facts that can hardly have escaped the Court\u2019s attention.  I therefore believe that the Chimel Court intended that its new rule apply in cases in which the arrestee is handcuffed before the search is conducted.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Belton Court, in my view, proceeded on the basis of this interpretation of Chimel.  Again speaking through Justice Stewart, the Belton Court reasoned that articles in the passenger compartment of a car are \u201cgenerally, even if not inevitably\u201d within an arrestee\u2019s reach.  453 U. S., at 460.  This is undoubtedly true at the time of the arrest of a person who is seated in a car but plainly not true when the person has been removed from the car and placed in handcuffs.  Accordingly, the Belton Court must have proceeded on the assumption that the Chimel rule was to be applied at the time of arrest.  And that is why the Belton Court was able to say that its decision \u201cin no way alter[ed] the fundamental principles established in the Chimel case regarding the basic scope of searches incident to lawful custodial arrests.\u201d  453 U. S., at 460, n.\u00a03.  Viewing Chimel as having focused on the time of arrest, Belton\u2019s only new step was to eliminate the need to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a particular person seated in a car actually could have reached the part of the passenger compartment where a weapon or evidence was hidden.  For this reason, if we are going to reexamine Belton, we should also reexamine the reasoning in Chimel on which Belton rests.\nF\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, however, does not reexamine Chimel and thus leaves the law relating to searches incident to arrest in a confused and unstable state.  The first part of the Court\u2019s new two-part rule\u2014which permits an arresting officer to search the area within an arrestee\u2019s reach at\nthe time of the search\u2014applies, at least for now, only to vehicle occupants and recent occupants, but there is no logical reason why the same rule should not apply to all arrestees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second part of the Court\u2019s new rule, which the Court takes uncritically from Justice Scalia\u2019s separate opinion in Thornton, raises doctrinal and practical problems that the Court makes no effort to address.  Why, for example, is the standard for this type of evidence-gathering search \u201creason to believe\u201d rather than probable cause?  And why is this type of search restricted to evidence of the offense of arrest?  It is true that an arrestee\u2019s vehicle is probably more likely to contain evidence of the crime of arrest than of some other crime, but if reason-to-believe is the governing standard for an evidence-gathering search incident to arrest, it is not easy to see why an officer should not be able to search when the officer has reason to believe that the vehicle in question possesses evidence of a crime other than the crime of arrest.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is it easy to see why an evidence-gathering search incident to arrest should be restricted to the passenger compartment.  The Belton rule was limited in this way because the passenger compartment was considered to be the area that vehicle occupants can generally reach, 453 U. S., at 460, but since the second part of the new rule is not based on officer safety or the preservation of evidence, the ground for this limitation is obscure.[Footnote 2]\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent in this case has not asked us to overrule Belton, much less Chimel.  Respondent\u2019s argument rests entirely on an interpretation of Belton that is plainly incorrect, an interpretation that disregards Belton\u2019s explicit delineation of its holding.  I would therefore leave any reexamination of our prior precedents for another day, if such a reexamination is to be undertaken at all.  In this case, I would simply apply Belton and reverse the judgment below.\n\u00a0See Moskovitz, A Rule in Search of a Reason: An Empirical Reexamination of Chimel and Belton, 2002 Wis. L. Rev. 657, 665.\n\u00a0I do not understand the Court\u2019s decision to reach the following situations.  First, it is not uncommon for an officer to arrest some but not all of the occupants of a vehicle.  The Court\u2019s decision in this case does not address the question whether in such a situation a search of the passenger compartment may be justified on the ground that the occupants who are not arrested could gain access to the car and retrieve a weapon or destroy evidence.  Second, there may be situations in which an arresting officer has cause to fear that persons who were not passengers in the car might attempt to retrieve a weapon or evidence from the car while the officer is still on the scene.  The decision in this case, as I understand it, does not address that situation either."}, {"id": 1767, "title": "Dissenting opinion", "author": null, "type": {"value": "dissenting", "label": "Dissenting opinion"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962909, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/332/dissent.html", "judge_full_name": "Stephen G.

Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), is best read as setting forth a bright-line rule that permits a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of an automobile incident to the lawful arrest of an occupant\u2014regardless of the danger the arrested individual in fact poses.  I also agree with Justice Stevens, however, that the rule can produce results divorced from its underlying Fourth Amendment rationale.  Compare Belton, supra, with Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, 764 (1969) (explaining that the rule allowing contemporaneous searches is justified by the need to prevent harm to a police officer or destruction of evidence of the crime).  For that reason I would look for a better rule\u2014were the question before us one of first impression.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The matter, however, is not one of first impression, and that fact makes a substantial difference.  The Belton rule has been followed not only by this Court in Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615 (2004), but also by numerous other courts.  Principles of stare decisis must apply, and those who wish this Court to change a well-established legal precedent\u2014where, as here, there has been considerable reliance on the legal rule in question\u2014bear a heavy burden.  Cf. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 17\u201319) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  I have not found that burden met.

GANT\ncertiorari to the supreme court of arizona\nNo. 07\u2013542.\u2003Argued October 7, 2008\u2014Decided April 21, 2009\nRespondent Gant was arrested for driving on a suspended license, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car before officers searched his car and found cocaine in a jacket pocket.  The Arizona trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, and he was convicted of drug offenses.  Reversing, the State Supreme Court distinguished New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454\u2014which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of a recent occupant\u2019s lawful arrest\u2014on the ground that it concerned the scope of a search incident to arrest but did not answer the question whether officers may conduct such a search once the scene has been secured.  Because Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, requires that a search incident to arrest be justified by either the interest in officer safety or the interest in preserving evidence and the circumstances of Gant\u2019s arrest implicated neither of those interests, the State Supreme Court found the search unreasonable. \nHeld:\u00a0Police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.

United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357.  The exception for a search incident to a lawful arrest applies only to \u201cthe area from within which [an arrestee] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d  Chimel, 395 U. S., at 763.  This Court applied that exception to the automobile context in Belton, the holding of which rested in large part on the assumption that articles inside a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment are \u201cgenerally \u2026 within \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  453 U.

Pp.\u00a05\u20138.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court rejects a broad reading of Belton that would permit a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest even if there were no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search.  The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimel\u2019s exception authorize a vehicle search only when there is a reasonable possibility of such access.  Although it does not follow from Chimel, circumstances unique to the automobile context also justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is \u201creasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u201d  Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Neither Chimel\u2019s reaching-distance rule nor Thornton\u2019s allowance for evidentiary searches authorized the search in this case.  In contrast to Belton, which involved a single officer confronted with four unsecured arrestees, five officers handcuffed and secured Gant and the two other suspects in separate patrol cars before the search began.  Gant clearly could not have accessed his car at the time of the search.  An evidentiary basis for the search was also lacking.  Belton and Thornton were both arrested for drug offenses, but Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license\u2014an offense for which police could not reasonably expect to find evidence in Gant\u2019s car.  Cf. Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 118.  The search in this case was therefore unreasonable.  Pp.\u00a08\u201311.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This Court is unpersuaded by the State\u2019s argument that its expansive reading of Belton correctly balances law enforcement interests with an arrestee\u2019s limited privacy interest in his vehicle.  The State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake, and it exaggerates both the clarity provided by a broad reading of Belton and its importance to law enforcement interests.  A narrow reading of Belton and Thornton, together with this Court\u2019s other Fourth Amendment decisions, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 103, and United States v. Ross, 456 U.

RODNEY JOSEPH GANT\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\narizona\n[April 21, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Rodney Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license, handcuffed, and locked in the back of a patrol car, police officers searched his car and discovered cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat.  Because Gant could not have accessed his car to retrieve weapons or evidence at the time of the search, the Arizona Supreme Court held that the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, as defined in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), and applied to vehicle searches in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), did not justify the search in this case.  We agree with that conclusion.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Chimel, police may search incident to arrest only the space within an arrestee\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018immediate control,\u2019\u00a0\u201d meaning \u201cthe area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d  395 U. S., at 763.  The safety and evidentiary justifications underlying Chimel\u2019s reaching-distance rule determine Belton\u2019s scope.  Accordingly, we hold that Belton does not authorize a vehicle search incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest after the arrestee has been secured and cannot access the interior of the vehicle.  Consistent with the holding in Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615 (2004), and following the suggestion in Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment in that case, id., at 632, we also conclude that circumstances unique to the automobile context justify a search incident to arrest when it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the offense of arrest might be found in the vehicle. \nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 25, 1999, acting on an anonymous tip that the residence at 2524 North Walnut Avenue was being used to sell drugs, Tucson police officers Griffith and Reed knocked on the front door and asked to speak to the owner.  Gant answered the door and, after identifying himself, stated that he expected the owner to return later.  The officers left the residence and conducted a records check, which revealed that Gant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended and there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for driving with a suspended license.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the officers returned to the house that evening, they found a man near the back of the house and a woman in a car parked in front of it.  After a third officer arrived, they arrested the man for providing a false name and the woman for possessing drug paraphernalia.  Both arrestees were handcuffed and secured in separate patrol cars when Gant arrived.  The officers recognized his car as it entered the driveway, and Officer Griffith confirmed that Gant was the driver by shining a flashlight into the car as it drove by him.  Gant parked at the end of the driveway, got out of his car, and shut the door.  Griffith, who was about 30 feet away, called to Gant, and they approached each other, meeting 10-to-12 feet from Gant\u2019s car.  Griffith immediately arrested Gant and handcuffed him.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the other arrestees were secured in the only patrol cars at the scene, Griffith called for backup.  When two more officers arrived, they locked Gant in the backseat of their vehicle.  After Gant had been handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol car, two officers searched his car: One of them found a gun, and the other discovered a bag of cocaine in the pocket of a jacket on the backseat.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gant was charged with two offenses\u2014possession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia (i.e., the plastic bag in which the cocaine was found).  He moved to suppress the evidence seized from his car on the ground that the warrantless search violated the Fourth Amendment.  Among other things, Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle.  When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted, Officer Griffith responded: \u201cBecause the law says we can do it.\u201d  App. 75.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court rejected the State\u2019s contention that the officers had probable cause to search Gant\u2019s car for contraband when the search began, id., at 18, 30, but it denied the motion to suppress.  Relying on the fact that the police saw Gant commit the crime of driving without a license and apprehended him only shortly after he exited his car, the court held that the search was permissible as a search incident to arrest.  Id., at 37.  A jury found Gant guilty on both drug counts, and he was sentenced to a 3-year term of imprisonment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After protracted state-court proceedings, the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the search of Gant\u2019s car was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The court\u2019s opinion discussed at length our decision in Belton, which held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle and any containers therein as a contemporaneous incident of an arrest of the vehicle\u2019s recent occupant.  216 Ariz. 1, 3\u20134, 162 P.\u00a03d 640, 642\u2013643 (2007) (citing 453 U. S., at 460).  The court distinguished Belton as a case concerning the permissible scope of a vehicle search incident to arrest and concluded that it did not answer \u201cthe threshold question whether the police may conduct a search incident to arrest at all once the scene is secure.\u201d  216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.\u00a03d, at 643.  Relying on our earlier decision in Chimel, the court observed that the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the warrant requirement is justified by interests in officer safety and evidence preservation.  216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.\u00a03d, at 643.  When \u201cthe justifications underlying Chimel no longer exist because the scene is secure and the arrestee is handcuffed, secured in the back of a patrol car, and under the supervision of an officer,\u201d the court concluded, a \u201cwarrantless search of the arrestee\u2019s car cannot be justified as necessary to protect the officers at the scene or prevent the destruction of evidence.\u201d  Id., at 5, 162 P.\u00a03d, at 644.  Accordingly, the court held that the search of Gant\u2019s car was unreasonable. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissenting justices would have upheld the search of Gant\u2019s car based on their view that \u201cthe validity of a Belton search \u2026 clearly does not depend on the presence of the Chimel rationales in a particular case.\u201d  Id., at 8, 162 P.\u00a03d, at 647.  Although they disagreed with the majority\u2019s view of Belton, the dissenting justices acknowledged that \u201c[t]he bright-line rule embraced in Belton has long been criticized and probably merits reconsideration.\u201d  216 Ariz., at 10, 162 P.\u00a03d, at 649.  They thus \u201cadd[ed their] voice[s] to the others that have urged the Supreme Court to revisit Belton.\u201d  Id., at 11, 163 P.\u00a03d, at 650.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The chorus that has called for us to revisit Belton includes courts, scholars, and Members of this Court who have questioned that decision\u2019s clarity and its fidelity to Fourth Amendment principles.  We therefore granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consistent with our precedent, our analysis begins, as it should in every case addressing the reasonableness of a warrantless search, with the basic rule that \u201csearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u2014subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d  Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967) (footnote omitted).  Among the exceptions to the warrant requirement is a search incident to a lawful arrest.  See Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914).  The exception derives from interests in officer safety and evidence preservation that are typically implicated in arrest situations.  See United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 230\u2013234 (1973); Chimel, 395 U. S., at 763.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Chimel, we held that a search incident to arrest may only include \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019\u2014construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d  Ibid.  That limitation, which continues to define the boundaries of the exception, ensures that the scope of a search incident to arrest is commensurate with its purposes of protecting arresting officers and safeguarding any evidence of the offense of arrest that an arrestee might conceal or destroy.  See ibid. (noting that searches incident to arrest are reasonable \u201cin order to remove any weapons [the arrestee] might seek to use\u201d and \u201cin order to prevent [the] concealment or destruction\u201d of evidence (emphasis added)).  If there is no possibility that an arrestee could reach into the area that law enforcement officers seek to search, both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply.  E.g., Preston v. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367\u2013368 (1964). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Belton, we considered Chimel\u2019s application to the automobile context.  A lone police officer in that case stopped a speeding car in which Belton was one of four occupants.  While asking for the driver\u2019s license and registration, the officer smelled burnt marijuana and observed an envelope on the car floor marked \u201cSupergold\u201d\u2014a name he associated with marijuana.  Thus having probable cause to believe the occupants had committed a drug offense, the officer ordered them out of the vehicle, placed them under arrest, and patted them down.  Without handcuffing the arrestees,[Footnote 1] the officer \u201c\u00a0\u2018split them up into four separate areas of the Thruway \u2026 so they would not be in physical touching area of each other\u2019\u00a0\u201d and searched the vehicle, including the pocket of a jacket on the backseat, in which he found cocaine.  453 U. S., at 456.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York Court of Appeals found the search unconstitutional, concluding that after the occupants were arrested the vehicle and its contents were \u201csafely within the exclusive custody and control of the police.\u201d  State v. Belton, 50 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 447, 452, 407 N.\u00a0E. 2d 420, 423 (1980).  The State asked this Court to consider whether the exception recognized in Chimel permits an officer to search \u201ca jacket found inside an automobile while the automobile\u2019s four occupants, all under arrest, are standing unsecured around the vehicle.\u201d  Brief in No. 80\u2013328, p.\u00a0i.  We granted certiorari because \u201ccourts ha[d] found no workable definition of \u2018the area within the immediate control of the arrestee\u2019 when that area arguably includes the interior of an automobile.\u201d  453 U. S., at 460.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its brief, the State argued that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the jacket was under the officer\u2019s exclusive control.  Focusing on the number of arrestees and their proximity to the vehicle, the State asserted that it was reasonable for the officer to believe the arrestees could have accessed the vehicle and its contents, making the search permissible under Chimel.  Brief in No. 80\u2013328, at\u00a07\u20138.  The United States, as amicus curiae in support of the State, argued for a more permissive standard, but it maintained that any search incident to arrest must be \u201c\u00a0\u2018substantially contemporaneous\u2019\u00a0\u201d with the arrest\u2014a requirement it deemed \u201csatisfied if the search occurs during the period in which the arrest is being consummated and before the situation has so stabilized that it could be said that the arrest was completed.\u201d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in New York v. Belton, O.\u00a0T. 1980, No. 80\u2013328, p. 14.  There was no suggestion by the parties or amici that Chimel authorizes a vehicle search incident to arrest when there is no realistic possibility that an arrestee could access his vehicle.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After considering these arguments, we held that when an officer lawfully arrests \u201cthe occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of the automobile\u201d and any containers therein.  Belton, 453 U. S., at 460 (footnote omitted).  That holding was based in large part on our assumption \u201cthat articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ibid. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arizona Supreme Court read our decision in Belton as merely delineating \u201cthe proper scope of a search of the interior of an automobile\u201d incident to an arrest, id., at 459. That is, when the passenger compartment is within an arrestee\u2019s reaching distance, Belton supplies the generalization that the entire compartment and any containers therein may be reached.  On that view of Belton, the state court concluded that the search of Gant\u2019s car was unreasonable because Gant clearly could not have accessed his car at the time of the search.  It also found that no other exception to the warrant requirement applied in this case.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gant now urges us to adopt the reading of Belton followed by the Arizona Supreme Court.   \nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the textual and evidentiary support for the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s reading of Belton, our opinion has been widely understood to allow a vehicle search incident to the arrest of a recent occupant even if there is no possibility the arrestee could gain access to the vehicle at the time of the search.  This reading may be attributable to Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in Belton, in which he characterized the Court\u2019s holding as resting on the \u201cfiction \u2026 that the interior of a car is always within the immediate control of an arrestee who has recently been in the car.\u201d  453 U. S., at 466.  Under the majority\u2019s approach, he argued, \u201cthe result would presumably be the same even if [the officer] had handcuffed Belton and his companions in the patrol car\u201d before conducting the search.  Id., at 468.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since we decided Belton, Courts of Appeals have given different answers to the question whether a vehicle must be within an arrestee\u2019s reach to justify a vehicle search incident to arrest,[Footnote 2] but Justice Brennan\u2019s reading of the Court\u2019s opinion has predominated.  As Justice O\u2019Connor observed, \u201clower court decisions seem now to treat the ability to search a vehicle incident to the arrest of a recent occupant as a police entitlement rather than as an exception justified by the twin rationales of Chimel.\u201d  Thornton, 541 U. S., at 624 (opinion concurring in part).  Justice Scalia has similarly noted that, although it is improbable that an arrestee could gain access to weapons stored in his vehicle after he has been handcuffed and secured in the backseat of a patrol car, cases allowing a search in \u201cthis precise factual scenario \u2026 are legion.\u201d  Id., at 628 (opinion concurring in judgment) (collecting cases).[Footnote 3]  Indeed, some courts have upheld searches under Belton \u201ceven when \u2026 the handcuffed arrestee has already left the scene.\u201d  541 U. S., at 628 (same).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under this broad reading of Belton, a vehicle search would be authorized incident to every arrest of a recent occupant notwithstanding that in most cases the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment will not be within the arrestee\u2019s reach at the time of the search.  To read Belton as authorizing a vehicle search incident to every recent occupant\u2019s arrest would thus untether the rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel exception\u2014a result clearly incompatible with our statement in Belton that it \u201cin no way alters the fundamental principles established in the Chimel case regarding the basic scope of searches incident to lawful custodial arrests.\u201d  453 U. S., at 460, n.\u00a03.  Accordingly, we reject this reading of Belton and hold that the Chimel rationale authorizes police to search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.[Footnote 4]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it does not follow from Chimel, we also conclude that circumstances unique to the vehicle context justify a search incident to a lawful arrest when it is \u201creasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u201d  Thornton, 541 U. S., at 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  In many cases, as when a recent occupant is arrested for a traffic violation, there will be no reasonable basis to believe the vehicle contains relevant evidence.  See, e.g., Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 324 (2001); Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 118 (1998).  But in others, including Belton and Thornton, the offense of arrest will supply a basis for searching the passenger compartment of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle and any containers therein.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the possibility of access nor the likelihood of discovering offense-related evidence authorized the search in this case.  Unlike in Belton, which involved a single officer confronted with four unsecured arrestees, the five officers in this case outnumbered the three arrestees, all of whom had been handcuffed and secured in separate patrol cars before the officers searched Gant\u2019s car.  Under those circumstances, Gant clearly was not within reaching distance of his car at the time of the search.  An evidentiary basis for the search was also lacking in this case.  Whereas Belton and Thornton were arrested for drug offenses, Gant was arrested for driving with a suspended license\u2014an offense for which police could not expect to find evidence in the passenger compartment of Gant\u2019s car.  Cf. Knowles, 525 U. S., at 118.  Because police could not reasonably have believed either that Gant could have accessed his car at the time of the search or that evidence of the offense for which he was arrested might have been found therein, the search in this case was unreasonable.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State does not seriously disagree with the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that Gant could not have accessed his vehicle at the time of the search, but it nevertheless asks us to uphold the search of his vehicle under the broad reading of Belton discussed above.  The State argues that Belton searches are reasonable regardless of the possibility of access in a given case because that expansive rule correctly balances law enforcement interests, including the interest in a bright-line rule, with an arrestee\u2019s limited privacy interest in his vehicle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several reasons, we reject the State\u2019s argument.  First, the State seriously undervalues the privacy interests at stake.  Although we have recognized that a motorist\u2019s privacy interest in his vehicle is less substantial than in his home, see New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, 112\u2013113 (1986), the former interest is nevertheless important and deserving of constitutional protection, see Knowles, 525 U. S., at 117.  It is particularly significant that Belton searches authorize police officers to search not just the passenger compartment but every purse, briefcase, or other container within that space.  A rule that gives police the power to conduct such a search whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense, when there is no basis for believing evidence of the offense might be found in the vehicle, creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals.  Indeed, the character of that threat implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendment\u2014the concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person\u2019s private effects.[Footnote 5]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time as it undervalues these privacy concerns, the State exaggerates the clarity that its reading of Belton provides.  Courts that have read Belton expansively are at odds regarding how close in time to the arrest and how proximate to the arrestee\u2019s vehicle an officer\u2019s first contact with the arrestee must be to bring the encounter within Belton\u2019s purview[Footnote 6] and whether a search is reasonable when it commences or continues after the arrestee has been removed from the scene.[Footnote 7]  The rule has thus generated a great deal of uncertainty, particularly for a rule touted as providing a \u201cbright line.\u201d  See 3 LaFave, \u00a77.1(c), at 514\u2013524.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to the State\u2019s suggestion, a broad reading of Belton is also unnecessary to protect law enforcement safety and evidentiary interests.  Under our view, Belton and Thornton permit an officer to conduct a vehicle search when an arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.  Other established exceptions to the warrant requirement authorize a vehicle search under additional circumstances when safety or evidentiary concerns demand.  For instance, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), permits an officer to search a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment when he has reasonable suspicion that an individual, whether or not the arrestee, is \u201cdangerous\u201d and might access the vehicle to \u201cgain immediate control of weapons.\u201d  Id., at 1049 (citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21 (1968)).  If there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity, United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 820\u2013821 (1982), authorizes a search of any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.  Unlike the searches permitted by Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion concurring in the judgment in Thornton, which we conclude today are reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, Ross allows searches for evidence relevant to offenses other than the offense of arrest, and the scope of the search authorized is broader.  Finally, there may be still other circumstances in which safety or evidentiary interests would justify a search.  Cf. Maryland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325, 334 (1990) (holding that, incident to arrest, an officer may conduct a limited protective sweep of those areas of a house in which he reasonably suspects a dangerous person may be hiding).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These exceptions together ensure that officers may search a vehicle when genuine safety or evidentiary concerns encountered during the arrest of a vehicle\u2019s recent occupant justify a search.  Construing Belton broadly to allow vehicle searches incident to any arrest would serve no purpose except to provide a police entitlement, and it is anathema to the Fourth Amendment to permit a warrantless search on that basis.  For these reasons, we are unpersuaded by the State\u2019s arguments that a broad reading of Belton would meaningfully further law enforcement interests and justify a substantial intrusion on individuals\u2019 privacy.[Footnote 8]\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our dissenting colleagues argue that the doctrine of stare decisis requires adherence to a broad reading of Belton even though the justifications for searching a vehicle incident to arrest are in most cases absent.[Footnote 9]  The doctrine of stare decisis is of course \u201cessential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law,\u201d but it does not compel us to follow a past decision when its rationale no longer withstands \u201ccareful analysis.\u201d  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have never relied on stare decisis to justify the continuance of an unconstitutional police practice.  And we would be particularly loath to uphold an unconstitutional result in a case that is so easily distinguished from the decisions that arguably compel it.  The safety and evidentiary interests that supported the search in Belton simply are not present in this case.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine two cases that are factually more distinct, as Belton involved one officer confronted by four unsecured arrestees suspected of committing a drug offense and this case involves several officers confronted with a securely detained arrestee apprehended for driving with a suspended license.  This case is also distinguishable from Thornton, in which the petitioner was arrested for a drug offense.  It is thus unsurprising that Members of this Court who concurred in the judgments in Belton and Thornton also concur in the decision in this case.[Footnote 10]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not agree with the contention in Justice Alito\u2019s dissent (hereinafter dissent) that consideration of police reliance interests requires a different result.  Although it appears that the State\u2019s reading of Belton has been widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers have relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years,[Footnote 11] many of these searches were not justified by the reasons underlying the Chimel exception.  Countless individuals guilty of nothing more serious than a traffic violation have had their constitutional right to the security of their private effects violated as a result.  The fact that the law enforcement community may view the State\u2019s version of the Belton rule as an entitlement does not establish the sort of reliance interest that could outweigh the countervailing interest that all individuals share in having their constitutional rights fully protected.  If it is clear that a practice is unlawful, individuals\u2019 interest in its discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement \u201centitlement\u201d to its persistence.  Cf. Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 393 (1978) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment\u201d).  The dissent\u2019s reference in this regard to the reliance interests cited in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000), is misplaced.  See post, at 5.  In observing that \u201cMiranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture,\u201d 530 U. S., at 443, the Court was referring not to police reliance on a rule requiring them to provide warnings but to the broader societal reliance on that individual right.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent also ignores the checkered history of the search-incident-to-arrest exception.  Police authority to search the place in which a lawful arrest is made was broadly asserted in Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192 (1927), and limited a few years later in Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344 (1931), and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452 (1932).  The limiting views expressed in Go-Bart and Lefokwitz were in turn abandoned in Harris v. United States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947), which upheld a search of a four-room apartment incident to the occupant\u2019s arrest.  Only a year later the Court in Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699, 708 (1948), retreated from that holding, noting that the search-incident-to-arrest exception is \u201ca strictly limited\u201d one that must be justified by \u201csomething more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest.\u201d  And just two years after that, in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), the Court again reversed course and upheld the search of an entire apartment.  Finally, our opinion in Chimel overruled Rabinowitz and what remained of Harris and established the present boundaries of the search-incident-to-arrest exception.  Notably, none of the dissenters in Chimel or the cases that preceded it argued that law enforcement reliance interests outweighed the interest in protecting individual constitutional rights so as to warrant fidelity to an unjustifiable rule.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experience of the 28 years since we decided Belton has shown that the generalization underpinning the broad reading of that decision is unfounded.  We now know that articles inside the passenger compartment are rarely \u201cwithin \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 453 U. S., at 460, and blind adherence to Belton\u2019s faulty assumption would authorize myriad unconstitutional searches.  The doctrine of stare decisis does not require us to approve routine constitutional violations.  \nVI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant\u2019s arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.  When these justifications are absent, a search of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies.  The Arizona Supreme Court correctly held that this case involved an unreasonable search.  Accordingly, the judgment of the State Supreme Court is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0The officer was unable to handcuff the occupants because he had only one set of handcuffs.  See Brief for Petitioner in New York v. Belton, O. T. 1980, No. 80\u2013328, p.\u00a03 (hereinafter Brief in No. 80\u2013328).\n\u00a0Compare United States v. Green, 324 F.\u00a03d 375, 379 (CA5 2003) (holding that Belton did not authorize a search of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle when he was handcuffed and lying facedown on the ground surrounded by four police officers 6-to-10 feet from the vehicle), United States v. Edwards, 242 F.\u00a03d 928, 938 (CA10 2001) (finding unauthorized a vehicle search conducted while the arrestee was handcuffed in the back of a patrol car), United States v. Vasey, 834 F.\u00a02d 782, 787 (CA9 1987) (finding unauthorized a vehicle search conducted 30-to-45 minutes after an arrest and after the arrestee had been handcuffed and secured in the back of a police car), with United States v. Hrasky, 453 F.\u00a03d 1099, 1102 (CA8 2006) (upholding a search conducted an hour after the arrestee was apprehended and after he had been handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol car); United States v. Weaver, 433 F.\u00a03d 1104, 1106 (CA9 2006) (upholding a search conducted 10-to-15 minutes after an arrest and after the arrestee had been handcuffed and secured in the back of a patrol car), and United States v. White, 871 F.\u00a02d 41, 44 (CA6 1989) (upholding a search conducted after the arrestee had been handcuffed and secured in the back of a police cruiser).\n\u00a0The practice of searching vehicles incident to arrest after the arrestee has been handcuffed and secured in a patrol car has not abated since we decided Thornton.  See, e.g., United States v. Murphy, 221 Fed. Appx. 715, 717 (CA10 2007); Hrasky, 453 F.\u00a03d, at 1100; Weaver, 433 F.\u00a03d, at 1105; United States v. Williams, 170 Fed. Appx. 399, 401 (CA6 2006); United States v. Dorsey, 418 F.\u00a03d 1038, 1041 (CA9 2005); United States v. Osife, 398 F. 3d 1143, 1144 (CA9 2005); United States v. Sumrall, 115 Fed. Appx. 22, 24 (CA10 2004).\n\u00a0Because officers have many means of ensuring the safe arrest of vehicle occupants, it will be the rare case in which an officer is unable to fully effectuate an arrest so that a real possibility of access to the arrestee\u2019s vehicle remains.  Cf. 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a77.1(c), p. 525 (4th ed. 2004) (hereinafter LaFave) (noting that the availability of protective measures \u201censur[es] the nonexistence of circumstances in which the arrestee\u2019s \u2018control\u2019 of the car is in doubt\u201d).  But in such a case a search incident to arrest is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n\u00a0See Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 84 (1987); Chimel, 395 U. S., at 760\u2013761; Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S. 476, 480\u2013484 (1965); Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 389\u2013392 (1914); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624\u2013625 (1886); see also 10 C.\u00a0Adams, The Works of John Adams 247\u2013248 (1856).  Many have observed that a broad reading of Belton gives police limitless discretion to conduct exploratory searches.  See 3 LaFave \u00a77.1(c), at 527 (observing that Belton creates the risk \u201cthat police will make custodial arrests which they otherwise would not make as a cover for a search which the Fourth Amendment otherwise prohibits\u201d); see also United States v. McLaughlin, 170 F.\u00a03d 889, 894 (CA9 1999) (Trott, J., concurring) (observing that Belton has been applied to condone \u201cpurely exploratory searches of vehicles during which officers with no definite objective or reason for the search are allowed to rummage around in a car to see what they might find\u201d); State v. Pallone, 2001 WI 77, \u00b6\u00b687\u201390, 236 Wis.\u00a02d 162, 203\u2013204, and n.\u00a09, 613 N.\u00a0W. 2d 568, 588, and n.\u00a09 (2000) (Abrahamson, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (same); State v. Pierce, 136 N.\u00a0J. 184, 211, 642 A.\u00a02d 947, 961 (1994) (same).\n\u00a0Compare United States v. Caseres, 533 F. 3d 1064, 1072 (CA9 2008) (declining to apply Belton when the arrestee was approached by police after he had exited his vehicle and reached his residence), with Rainey v. Commonwealth, 197 S. W. 3d 89, 94\u201395 (Ky. 2006) (applying Belton when the arrestee was apprehended 50 feet from the vehicle), and Black v. State, 810 N. E. 2d 713, 716 (Ind. 2004) (applying Belton when the arrestee was apprehended inside an auto repair shop and the vehicle was parked outside).\n\u00a0Compare McLaughlin, 170 F.\u00a03d, at 890\u2013891 (upholding a search that commenced five minutes after the arrestee was removed from the scene), United States v. Snook, 88 F.\u00a03d 605, 608 (CA8 1996) (same), and United States v. Doward, 41 F.\u00a03d 789, 793 (CA1 1994) (upholding a search that continued after the arrestee was removed from the scene), with United States v. Lugo, 978 F.\u00a02d 631, 634 (CA10 1992) (holding invalid a search that commenced after the arrestee was removed from the scene), and State v. Badgett, 200 Conn. 412, 427\u2013428, 512 A.\u00a02d 160, 169 (1986) (holding invalid a search that continued after the arrestee was removed from the scene).\n\u00a0At least eight States have reached the same conclusion.  Vermont, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Oregon, and Wyoming have declined to follow a broad reading of Belton under their state constitutions.  See State v. Bauder, 181 Vt. 392, 401, 924 A.\u00a02d 38, 46\u201347 (2007); State v. Eckel, 185 N.\u00a0J. 523, 540, 888 A.\u00a02d 1266, 1277 (2006); Camacho v. State, 119 Nev. 395, 399\u2013400, 75 P.\u00a03d 370, 373\u2013374 (2003); Vasquez v. State, 990 P.\u00a02d 476, 488\u2013489 (Wyo. 1999); State v. Arredondo, 1997\u2013NMCA\u2013081, 123 N.\u00a0M. 628, 636 (Ct. App.), overruled on other grounds by State v. Steinzig, 1999\u2013NMCA\u2013107, 127 N.\u00a0M. 752 (Ct. App.); Commonwealth v. White, 543 Pa. 45, 57, 669 A.\u00a02d 896, 902 (1995); People v. Blasich, 73 N.\u00a0Y. 2d 673, 678, 541 N.\u00a0E. 2d 40, 43 (1989); State v. Fesler, 68 Ore. App. 609, 612, 685 P.\u00a02d 1014, 1016\u20131017 (1984).  And a Massachusetts statute provides that a search incident to arrest may be made only for the purposes of seizing weapons or evidence of the offense of arrest.  See Commonwealth v. Toole, 389 Mass. 159, 161\u2013162, 448 N.\u00a0E. 2d 1264, 1266\u20131267 (1983) (citing Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 276, \u00a71 (West 2007)).\n\u00a0Justice Alito\u2019s dissenting opinion also accuses us of \u201coverrul[ing]\u201d Belton and Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615 (2004), \u201ceven though respondent Gant has not asked us to do so.\u201d  Post, at 1.  Contrary to that claim, the narrow reading of Belton we adopt today is precisely the result Gant has urged.  That Justice Alito has chosen to describe this decision as overruling our earlier cases does not change the fact that the resulting rule of law is the one advocated by respondent.  \n\u00a0Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment in Belton, 453 U. S., at 463, for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 444 (1981), Justice Thomas joined the Court\u2019s opinion in Thornton, 541 U. S. 615, and Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg concurred in the judgment in that case, id., at 625. \n\u00a0Because a broad reading of Belton has been widely accepted, the doctrine of qualified immunity will shield officers from liability for searches conducted in reasonable reliance on that understanding."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/332/"}, {"ID": 55588, "name": "Crawford v.

When the investigation concluded, Crawford was fired based on charges of embezzlement and drug use. When these charges were later proven untrue, Crawford filed suit against her employer in federal district court in Tennessee claiming retaliatory discharge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act based on her participation in the investigation. The district court directed a verdict for her employer.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling. Once again finding for the employer, the court stated that Crawford's participation in the investigation did not constitute \"opposition\" and her activity in that regard was not \"protected\" as those terms are defined in Title VII, making the Civil Rights Act inapplicable to her claim.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act apply to employees fired for participating in an internal investigation of sexual harassment?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. In a unanimous decision with Justice David H. Souter writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It held that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII extends to people who speak out, not just on their own initiative, but when prompted by an employer's internal investigation. The Court reasoned that the plain meaning of the statute includes people who \"oppose\" sexually obnoxious behavior by merely disclosing the violation and need not initiate the disclosure.</p>\n<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito filed a separate concurring opinion and was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Alito noted that, while not addressed in the majority opinion, the plain meaning of \"oppose\" should not include \"silent opposition.\" He argued it would open the door to plaintiffs who never expressed opposition to their employers, thus raising difficult factual determinations at trial.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 23226, "name": "Eric Schnapper", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/eric_schnapper", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Schnapper", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "eric_schnapper"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19783"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 24816, "name": "Francis H.

Sections 201 and 311 require the disclosure of donors to such communication and a disclaimer when the communication is not authorized by the candidate it intends to support.</p>\n<p>Citizens United argued that: 1) Section 203 violates the First Amendment on its face and when applied to <em>The Movie</em> and its related advertisements, and that 2) Sections 201 and 203 are also unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances.</p>\n<p>The United States District Court denied the injunction. Section 203 on its face was not unconstitutional because the Supreme Court in <em>McConnell v. FEC</em> had already reached that determination. The District Court also held that <em>The Movie</em> was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, as it attempted to inform voters that Senator Clinton was unfit for office, and thus Section 203 was not unconstitutionally applied. Lastly, it held that Sections 201 and 203 were not unconstitutional as applied to the <em>The Movie</em> or its advertisements. The court reasoned that the <em>McConnell</em> decision recognized that disclosure of donors \"might be unconstitutional if it imposed an unconstitutional burden on the freedom to associate in support of a particular cause,\" but those circumstances did not exist in Citizen United's claim.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Did the Supreme Court's decision in <em>McConnell</em> resolve all constitutional as-applied challenges to the BCRA when it upheld the disclosure requirements of the statute as constitutional?</p>\n<p>2) Do the BCRA's disclosure requirements impose an unconstitutional burden when applied to electioneering requirements because they are protected \"political speech\" and not subject to regulation as \"campaign speech\"?</p>\n<p>3) If a communication lacks a clear plea to vote for or against a particular candidate, is it subject to regulation under the BCRA?</p>\n<p>4) Should a feature length documentary about a candidate for political office be treated like the advertisements at issue in <em>McConnell</em> and therefore be subject to regulation under the BCRA?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. No. Yes. Yes. The Supreme Court overruled <em>Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em> and portions of <em>McConnell v. FEC</em>. (In the prior cases, the Court had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.) By a 5-to-4 vote along ideological lines, the majority held that under the First Amendment corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. The majority maintained that political speech is indispensable to a democracy, which is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation. The majority also held that the BCRA's disclosure requirements as applied to <em>The Movie</em> were constitutional, reasoning that disclosure is justified by a \"governmental interest\" in providing the \"electorate with information\" about election-related spending resources. The Court also upheld the disclosure requirements for political advertising sponsors and it upheld the ban on direct contributions to candidates from corporations and unions.</p>\n<p>In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Alito, emphasized the care with which the Court handles constitutional issues and its attempts to avoid constitutional issues when at all possible. Here, the Court had no narrower grounds upon which to rule, except to handle the First Amendment issues embodied within the case. Justice Scalia also wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Thomas in part, criticizing Justice Stevens' understanding of the Framer's view towards corporations. Justice Stevens argued that corporations are not members of society and that there are compelling governmental interests to curb corporations' ability to spend money during local and national elections.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 43165, "name": "Theodore B.

Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) has never been reconcilable with that protection.  By striking down \u00a7203, the Court takes an important first step toward restoring full constitutional protection to speech that is \u201cindispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government.\u201d  McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 265 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted).  I dissent from Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion, however, because the Court\u2019s constitutional analysis does not go far enough.  The disclosure, disclaimer, and reporting requirements in BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 are also unconstitutional.  See id., at 275\u2013277, and n.\u00a010.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress may not abridge the \u201cright to anonymous speech\u201d based on the \u201c\u00a0\u2018simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 276 (quoting McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334, 348 (1995)).  In continuing to hold otherwise, the Court misapprehends the import of \u201crecent events\u201d that some amici describe \u201cin which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.\u201d  Ante, at 54.  The Court properly recognizes these events as \u201ccause for concern,\u201d ibid., but fails to acknowledge their constitutional significance.  In my view, amici\u2019s submissions show why the Court\u2019s insistence on upholding \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 will ultimately prove as misguided (and ill fated) as was its prior approval of \u00a7203.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amici\u2019s examples relate principally to Proposition 8, a state ballot proposition that California voters narrowly passed in the 2008 general election.  Proposition 8 amended California\u2019s constitution to provide that \u201c[o]nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\u201d  Cal. Const., Art. I, \u00a77.5.  Any donor who gave more than $100 to any committee supporting or opposing Proposition 8 was required to disclose his full name, street address, occupation, employer\u2019s name (or business name, if self-employed), and the total amount of his contributions.[Footnote 1]  See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a784211(f) (West 2005).  The California Secretary of State was then required to post this information on the Internet.  See \u00a7\u00a784600\u201384601; \u00a7\u00a784602\u201384602.1 (West Supp. 2010); \u00a7\u00a784602.5\u201384604 (West 2005); \u00a785605 (West Supp. 2010); \u00a7\u00a784606\u201384609 (West 2005).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some opponents of Proposition 8 compiled this information and created Web sites with maps showing the locations of homes or businesses of Proposition 8 supporters.  Many supporters (or their customers) suffered property damage, or threats of physical violence or death, as a result.  They cited these incidents in a complaint they filed after the 2008 election, seeking to invalidate California\u2019s mandatory disclosure laws.  Supporters recounted being told: \u201cConsider yourself lucky.  If I had a gun I would have gunned you down along with each and every other supporter,\u201d or, \u201cwe have plans for you and your friends.\u201d  Complaint in ProtectMarriage.com\u2014Yes on 8 v. Bowen, Case No. 2:09\u2013cv\u201300058\u2013MCE\u2013DAD (ED Cal.), \u00b631.  Proposition 8 opponents also allegedly harassed the measure\u2019s supporters by defacing or damaging their property.  Id., \u00b632.  Two religious organizations supporting Proposition 8 reportedly received through the mail envelopes containing a white powdery substance.  Id., \u00b633.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those accounts are consistent with media reports describing Proposition 8-related retaliation.  The director of the nonprofit California Musical Theater gave $1,000 to support the initiative; he was forced to resign after artists complained to his employer.  Lott & Smith, Donor Disclosure Has Its Downsides, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 26, 2008, p. A13.  The director of the Los Angeles Film Festival was forced to resign after giving $1,500 because opponents threatened to boycott and picket the next festival.  Ibid.  And a woman who had managed her popular, family-owned restaurant for 26 years was forced to resign after she gave $100, because \u201cthrongs of [angry] protesters\u201d repeatedly arrived at the restaurant and \u201cshout[ed] \u2018shame on you\u2019 at customers.\u201d  Lopez, Prop. 8 Stance Upends Her Life, Los\u00a0Angeles Times, Dec. 14, 2008, p. B1.  The police even had to \u201carriv[e] in riot gear one night to quell the angry mob\u201d at the restaurant.  Ibid.  Some supporters of Proposition 8 engaged in similar tactics; one real estate businessman in San Diego who had donated to a group opposing Proposition 8 \u201creceived a letter from the Prop. 8 Executive Committee threatening to publish his company\u2019s name if he didn\u2019t also donate to the \u2018Yes on 8\u2019 campaign.\u201d  Donor Disclosure, supra, at A13.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The success of such intimidation tactics has apparently spawned a cottage industry that uses forcibly disclosed donor information to pre-empt citizens\u2019 exercise of their First Amendment rights.  Before the 2008 Presidential election, a \u201cnewly formed nonprofit group \u2026 plann[ed] to confront donors to conservative groups, hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions.\u201d  Luo, Group Plans Campaign Against G.O.P. Donors, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2008, p. A15.  Its leader, \u201cwho described his effort as \u2018going for the jugular,\u2019\u00a0\u201d detailed the group\u2019s plan to send a \u201cwarning letter \u2026 alerting donors who might be considering giving to right-wing groups to a variety of potential dangers, including legal trouble, public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These instances of retaliation sufficiently demonstrate why this Court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements.  But amici present evidence of yet another reason to do so\u2014the threat of retaliation from elected officials.  As amici\u2019s submissions make clear, this threat extends far beyond a single ballot proposition in California.  For example, a candidate challenging an incumbent state attorney general reported that some members of the State\u2019s business community feared donating to his campaign because they did not want to cross the incumbent; in his words, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I go to so many people and hear the same thing: \u201cI sure hope you beat [the incumbent], but I can\u2019t afford to have my name on your records.  He might come after me next.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Strassel, Challenging Spitzerism at the Polls, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2008, p. A11.  The incumbent won reelection in 2008.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My point is not to express any view on the merits of the political controversies I describe.  Rather, it is to demonstrate\u2014using real-world, recent examples\u2014the fallacy in the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements \u2026 impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.\u201d  Ante, at 51 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Of course they do.  Disclaimer and disclosure requirements enable private citizens and elected officials to implement political strategies specifically calculated to curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied challenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate those speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can \u201cshow a reasonable probability that disclosure \u2026 will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\u201d  Ante, at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Court\u2019s opinion itself proves the irony in this compromise.  In correctly explaining why it must address the facial constitutionality of \u00a7203, see ante, at 5\u201320, the Court recognizes that \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to \u2026 seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day,\u201d ante, at 7; that as-applied challenges to \u00a7203 \u201cwould require substantial litigation over an extended time\u201d and result in an \u201cinterpretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable,\u201d ante, at 9\u201310; that \u201ca court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling,\u201d ante, at 12; and that avoiding a facial challenge to \u00a7203 \u201cwould prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect\u201d that \u00a7203 causes, ante, at 16.  This logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied challenges to \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Irony aside, the Court\u2019s promise that as-applied challenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assurance.  Now more than ever, \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 will chill protected speech because\u2014as California voters can attest\u2014\u201cthe advent of the Internet\u201d enables \u201cprompt  disclosure of expenditures,\u201d which \u201cprovide[s]\u201d political opponents \u201cwith the information needed\u201d to intimidate and retaliate against their foes.  Ante, at 55.  Thus, \u201cdisclosure permits citizens \u2026 to react to the speech of [their political opponents] in a proper\u201d\u2014or undeniably improper\u2014\u201cway\u201d long before a plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.[Footnote 2]  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot endorse a view of the First Amendment that subjects citizens of this Nation to death threats, ruined careers, damaged or defaced property, or pre-emptive and threatening warning letters as the price for engaging in \u201ccore political speech, the \u2018primary object of First Amendment protection.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 264 (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410\u2013411 (2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting)).  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment upholding BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.\n\u00a0BCRA imposes similar disclosure requirements.  See, e.g., 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7434(f)(2)(F) (\u201cEvery person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any calendar year\u201d must disclose \u201cthe names and addresses of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making the disbursement\u201d).\n\u00a0But cf. Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 707\u2013710 (2000) (approving a statute restricting speech \u201cwithin 100 feet\u201d of abortion clinics because it protected women seeking an abortion from \u201c\u00a0\u2018sidewalk counseling,\u2019\u00a0\u201d which \u201cconsists of efforts \u2018to educate, counsel, persuade, or inform passersby about abortion and abortion alternatives by means of verbal or written speech,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and which \u201csometimes\u201d involved \u201cstrong and abusive language in face-to-face encounters\u201d)."}, {"id": 1730, "title": "Concurring in-part, dissenting in-part", "author": null, "type": {"value": "inpart", "label": "Concurring in-part, dissenting in-part"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1963047, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/08-205/cdinpart.html", "judge_full_name": "John Paul Stevens", "judge_last_name": "Stevens", "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1730", "justia_text": "CITIZENS UNITED, APPELLANT v. FEDERAL\nELECTION COMMISSION\non appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia\n[January 21, 2010]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, the appellant may finance its electioneering.  Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets.  Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), it could have used those assets to televise and promote Hillary: The Movie wherever and whenever it wanted to.  It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election.  Neither Citizens United\u2019s nor any other corporation\u2019s speech has been \u201cbanned,\u201d ante, at 1.  All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30-day period.  The notion that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is, in my judgment, profoundly misguided.  Even more misguided is the notion that the Court must rewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by for-profit corporations and unions to decide this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic premise underlying the Court\u2019s ruling is its iteration, and constant reiteration, of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker\u2019s identity, including its \u201cidentity\u201d as a corporation.  While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law.  Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose.  It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC.  The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court\u2019s disposition of this case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant.  Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it.  They cannot vote or run for office.  Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters.  The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process.  Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past.  Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864.  We have unanimously concluded that this \u201creflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process,\u201d FEC v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 209 (1982) (NRWC), and have accepted the \u201clegislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation,\u201d id., at 209\u2013210.  The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990).  Relying largely on individual dissenting opinions, the majority blazes through our precedents, overruling or disavowing a body of case law including FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL), McConnell v. FEC, 540 U. S. 93 (2003), FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003), FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986) (MCFL), NRWC, 459 U. S. 197, and California Medical Assn. v. FEC, 453 U. S. 182 (1981).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his landmark concurrence in Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346 (1936), Justice Brandeis stressed the importance of adhering to rules the Court has \u201cdeveloped \u2026 for its own governance\u201d when deciding constitutional questions.  Because departures from those rules always enhance the risk of error, I shall review the background of this case in some detail before explaining why the Court\u2019s analysis rests on a faulty understanding of Austin and McConnell and of our campaign finance jurisprudence more generally\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.[Footnote 1]  I regret the length of what follows, but the importance and novelty of the Court\u2019s opinion require a full response.  Although I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to sustain BCRA\u2019s disclosure provisions and join Part IV\nof its opinion, I emphatically dissent from its principal holding.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation.  The path it has taken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this institution.  Before turning to the question whether to overrule Austin and part of McConnell, it is important\nto explain why the Court should not be deciding that question.\nScope of the Case\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first reason is that the question was not properly brought before us.  In declaring \u00a7203 of BCRA facially unconstitutional on the ground that corporations\u2019 electoral expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently than those of individuals, the majority decides this case on a basis relinquished below, not included in the questions presented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in response to the Court\u2019s invitation.  This procedure is unusual and inadvisable for a court.[Footnote 2]  Our colleagues\u2019 suggestion that \u201cwe are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell,\u201d ante, at 1, would be more accurate if rephrased to state that \u201cwe have asked ourselves\u201d to reconsider those cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the District Court, Citizens United initially raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7203.  App. 23a\u201324a.  In its motion for summary judgment, however, Citizens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge, 1:07\u2013cv\u20132240\u2013RCL\u2013RWR, Docket Entry No. 52, pp. 1\u20132 (May 16, 2008), and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of that claim, id., Nos. 53 (May 22, 2008), 54 (May 23, 2008), App. 6a.  The District Court therefore resolved the case on alternative grounds,[Footnote 3] and in its jurisdictional statement to this Court, Citizens United properly advised us that it was raising only \u201can as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of \u2026 BCRA \u00a7203.\u201d  Juris. Statement 5.  The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited Austin, the key case the majority today overrules.  And not one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to \u00a7203 that it previously agreed to dismiss.  In fact, not one of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens United\u2019s corporate status.  Juris. Statement (i).  Moreover, even in its merits briefing, when Citizens United injected its request to overrule Austin, it never sought a declaration that \u00a7203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corporations and unions; instead it argued only that the statute could not be applied to it because it was \u201cfunded overwhelmingly by individuals.\u201d  Brief for Appellant 29; see also id., at 10, 12, 16, 28 (affirming \u201cas applied\u201d character of challenge to \u00a7203); Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\u20139 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United conceding that \u00a7203 could be applied to General Motors); id., at 55 (counsel for Citizens United stating that \u201cwe accept the Court\u2019s decision in Wisconsin Right to Life\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u00a0\u2018It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 234 (1976) (per curiam) (quoting Duignan v. United States, 274 U. S. 195, 200 (1927)), and it is \u201conly in the most exceptional cases\u201d that we will consider issues outside the questions presented, Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 481, n. 15 (1976).  The appellant in this case did not so much as assert an exceptional circumstance, and one searches the majority opinion in vain for the mention of any.  That is unsurprising, for none exists.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step, but it did not cure this fundamental problem.  Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us, so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law.\nAs-Applied and Facial Challenges\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years that \u201c[f]acial challenges are disfavored.\u201d  Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008); see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329 (2006) (\u201c[T]he \u2018normal rule\u2019 is that \u2018partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\u2019 such that a \u2018statute may \u2026 be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985); alteration in original)).  By declaring \u00a7203 facially unconstitutional, our colleagues have turned an as-applied challenge into a facial challenge, in defiance of this principle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not merely a technical defect in the Court\u2019s decision.  The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry \u201crun[s] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\u201d Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Scanting that principle \u201cthreaten[s] to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.\u201d  Id., at 451.  These concerns are heightened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the legislature has relied.  The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress\u2019 most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics.  It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of this on the basis of pure speculation.  Had Citizens United maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA \u00a7203 can be applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed, through the normal process of litigation, a record about the actual effects of \u00a7203, its actual burdens and its actual benefits, on all manner of corporations and unions.[Footnote 4]  \u201cClaims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,\u201d and consequently \u201craise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\u201d  Id., at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is nonexistent.  Congress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert.  The Court now negates Congress\u2019 efforts without a shred of evidence on how \u00a7203 or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority throws up its hands.  Were we to confine our inquiry to Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge, it protests, we would commence an \u201cextended\u201d process of \u201cdraw[ing], and then redraw[ing], constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.\u201d  Ante, at 9.  While tacitly acknowledging that some applications of \u00a7203 might be found constitutional, the majority thus posits a future in which novel First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad\u00a0hoc basis, and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal restraint.  Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies, may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins.  The fluid nature of electioneering communications does not make this case special.  The fact that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some point down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied problems, does not come close to meeting the standard for a facial challenge.[Footnote 6]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority proposes several other justifications for the sweep of its ruling.  It suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because, if the Court were to continue on its normal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they present themselves, that process would itself run afoul of the First Amendment.  See, e.g., ante, at 9 (as-applied review process \u201cwould raise questions as to the courts\u2019 own lawful authority\u201d); ibid. (\u201cCourts, too, are bound by the First Amendment\u201d).  This suggestion is perplexing.  Our colleagues elsewhere trumpet \u201cour duty \u2018to say what the law is,\u2019\u00a0\u201d even when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differently.  Ante, at 49 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).  We do not typically say what the law is not as a hedge against future judicial error.  The possibility that later courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that provision.[Footnote 7]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech.  See ante, at 9\u201310, 12, 16\u201320.  In addition to begging the question what types of corporate spending are constitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim rests on the assertion that some significant number of corporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC \u201c\u00a0\u2018censor[ship].\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 18\u201319.  That assertion is unsubstantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experience.  It is particularly hard to square with the legal landscape following WRTL, which held that a corporate communication could be regulated under \u00a7203 only if it was \u201csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\u201d  551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (emphasis added).  The whole point of this test was to make \u00a7203 as simple and speech-protective as possible.  The Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election cycle, it has determined The Chief Justice\u2019s project to be a failure.  In this respect, too, the majority\u2019s critique of line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied review method generally.[Footnote 8]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority suggests that, even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United nevertheless preserved it\u2014not as a freestanding \u201cclaim,\u201d but as a potential argument in support of \u201ca claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.\u201d  Ante, at 13; see also ante, at 4 (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., concurring) (describing Citizens United\u2019s claim as: \u201c[T]he Act violates the First Amendment\u201d).  By this novel logic, virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as \u201ca claim that the Government has violated my rights,\u201d and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim\u2019s disposition.  Not only the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic relationship between litigants and courts, would be upended if the latter had free rein to construe the former\u2019s claims at such high levels of generality.  There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the rest to us.[Footnote 9]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of Citizens United\u2019s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is necessary as a matter of remedy.  Relying on a law review article, it asserts that Citizens United\u2019s dismissal of the facial challenge does not prevent us \u201c\u00a0\u2018from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \u201cas-applied\u201d cases.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 14 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (hereinafter Fallon)); accord, ante, at 5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (\u201cRegardless whether we label Citizens United\u2019s claim a \u2018facial\u2019 or \u2018as-applied\u2019 challenge, the consequences of the Court\u2019s decision are the same\u201d).  The majority is on firmer conceptual ground here.  Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor Fallon\u2019s thesis, one must proceed to ask which as-applied challenges, if successful, will \u201cproperly\u201d invite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute.[Footnote 10]  The paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as this carries the necessary implication that all future as-applied challenges to the provision must prevail.  See Fallon 1339\u20131340.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge was not of this sort.  Until this Court ordered reargument, its contention was that BCRA \u00a7203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature-length video-on-demand film (such as Hillary) or to a nonprofit corporation exempt from taxation under 26 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7501(c)(4)[Footnote 11] and funded overwhelmingly by individuals (such as itself).  See Brief for Appellant 16\u201341.  Success on either of these claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the validity of \u00a7203 as applied to other types of broadcasts, other types of corporations, or unions.  It certainly would not invalidate the statute as applied to a large for-profit corporation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 4 (Mar. 24, 2009) (counsel for Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is \u201ca small, nonprofit organization, which is very much like [an MCFL corporation],\u201d and affirming that its argument \u201cdefinitely would not be the same\u201d if Hillary were distributed by General Motors).[Footnote 12]  There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago.\nNarrower Grounds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge, because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens United, without toppling statutes and precedents.  Which is to say, the majority has transgressed yet another \u201ccardinal\u201d principle of the judicial process: \u201c[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\u201d PDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 362 F.\u00a03d 786, 799 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision that the majority has bypassed.  First, the Court could have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify as an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d under \u00a7203 of BCRA, 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b.  BCRA defines that term to encompass certain communications transmitted by \u201cbroadcast, cable, or satellite.\u201d  \u00a7434(f)(3)(A).  When Congress was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very different sort of programming: short advertisements run on television or radio.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207.  The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC\u2019s implementing regulations do not clearly apply to video-on-demand transmissions.  See Brief for Senator John McCain et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201319.  In light of this ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on-demand, and \u201c[t]he elementary rule \u2026 that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895), the Court could have reasonably ruled that \u00a7203 does not apply to Hillary.[Footnote 13]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court could have expanded the MCFL exemption to cover \u00a7501(c)(4) nonprofits that accept only a de minimis amount of money from for-profit corporations.  Citizens United professes to be such a group: Its brief says it \u201cis funded predominantly by donations from individuals who support [its] ideological message.\u201d  Brief for Appellant 5.  Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that de minimis business support does not, in itself, remove an otherwise qualifying organization from the ambit of MCFL.[Footnote 14]  This Court could have simply followed their lead.[Footnote 15]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, let us not forget Citizens United\u2019s as-applied constitutional challenge.  Precisely because Citizens United looks so much like the MCFL organizations we have exempted from regulation, while a feature-length video-on-demand film looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation, this challenge is a substantial one.  As the appellant\u2019s own arguments show, the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must always be treated identically\u2014and always spared expenditures restrictions\u2014in the political realm.  Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review process that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation since Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in WRTL, 551 U. S. 449.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case could have been decided is not meant to show that any of these grounds is ideal, though each is perfectly \u201cvalid,\u201d ante, at 12 (majority opinion).[Footnote 16]  It is meant to show that there were principled, narrower paths that a Court that was serious about judicial restraint could have taken.  There was also the straightforward path: applying Austin and McConnell, just as the District Court did in holding that the funding of Citizens United\u2019s film can be regulated under them.  The only thing preventing the majority from affirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower ground that would retain Austin, is its disdain for Austin.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is the most transparent: stare decisis.  I am not an absolutist when it comes to stare decisis, in the campaign finance area or in any other.  No one is.  But if this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law, it must at least demand a significant justification, beyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning settled doctrine.  \u201c[A] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided.\u201d  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 864 (1992).  No such justification exists in this case, and to the contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our precedents.[Footnote 17]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s central argument for why stare decisis ought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin.  The opinion \u201cwas not well reasoned,\u201d our colleagues assert, and it conflicts with First Amendment principles.  Ante, at 47\u201348.  This, of course, is the Court\u2019s merits argument, the many defects in which we will soon consider.  I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it.  But neither is true of Austin, as I explain at length in Parts III and IV, infra, at 23\u201389, and restating a merits argument with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in the stare decisis calculus.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supplements its merits case with a smattering of assertions.  The Court proclaims that \u201cAustin is undermined by experience since its announcement.\u201d  Ante, at 48.  This is a curious claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record.  The majority has no empirical evidence with which to substantiate the claim; we just have its ipse dixit that the real world has not been kind to Austin.  Nor does the majority bother to specify in what sense Austin has been \u201cundermined.\u201d  Instead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs: \u201cOur Nation\u2019s speech dynamic is changing,\u201d ante, at 48; \u201c[s]peakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages,\u201d ibid.; \u201c[c]orporations \u2026 do not have monolithic views,\u201d ibid.  How any of these ruminations weakens the force of stare decisis, escapes my comprehension.[Footnote 18]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also contends that the Government\u2019s hesitation to rely on Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale \u201cdiminishe[s]\u201d \u201cthe principle of adhering to that precedent.\u201d  Ante, at 48; see also ante, at 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (Government\u2019s litigating position is \u201cmost importan[t]\u201d factor undermining Austin).  Why it diminishes the value of stare decisis is left unexplained.  We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack.  Nor should we.  Our decisions can often be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may have strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing only a subset of them.  Members of the public, moreover, often rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our precise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been regulating corporate electioneering since Austin.  The task of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.[Footnote 19]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the majority opinion spends several pages making these surprising arguments, it says almost nothing about the standard considerations we have used to determine stare decisis value, such as the antiquity of the precedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reliance interests at stake.  It is also conspicuously silent about McConnell, even though the McConnell Court\u2019s decision to uphold BCRA \u00a7203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of Austin but also on the statute\u2019s historical pedigree, see, e.g., 540 U. S., at 115\u2013132, 223\u2013224, and the need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns, see id., at 126\u2013129, 205\u2013208, and n.\u00a088.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have recognized that \u201c[s]tare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens \u2018have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Hubbard v. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714 (1995) (quoting Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991)).  Stare decisis protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion.  Today\u2019s decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise.  State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in Austin, for more than a century.[Footnote 20]  The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on Austin throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA.  The total record it compiled was 100,000 pages long.[Footnote 21]  Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of \u00a7203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By removing one of its central components, today\u2019s ruling makes a hash out of BCRA\u2019s \u201cdelicate and interconnected regulatory scheme.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 172.  Consider just one example of the distortions that will follow: Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or spending \u201csoft money,\u201d funds that are not subject to the statute\u2019s disclosure requirements or its source and amount limitations.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441i; McConnell, 540 U. S., at 122\u2013126.  Going forward, corporations and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific candidates, whereas national parties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of any kind.  The Court\u2019s ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of corporations and unions\u2014and the narrow interests they represent\u2014vis-\u00c0-vis the role of political parties\u2014and the broad coalitions they represent\u2014in determining who will hold public office.[Footnote 22]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond the reliance interests at stake, the other stare decisis factors also cut against the Court.  Considerations of antiquity are significant for similar reasons.  McConnell is only six years old, but Austin has been on the books for two decades, and many of the statutes called into question by today\u2019s opinion have been on the books for a half-century or more.  The Court points to no intervening change in circumstances that warrants revisiting Austin.  Certainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided WRTL two Terms ago.  And the Court gives no reason to think that Austin and McConnell are unworkable.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, no one has argued to us that Austin\u2019s rule has proved impracticable, and not a single for-profit corporation, union, or State has asked us to overrule it.  Quite to the contrary, leading groups representing the business community,[Footnote 23] organized labor,[Footnote 24] and the nonprofit sector,[Footnote 25] together with more than half of the States,[Footnote 26] urge that we preserve Austin.  As for McConnell, the portions of BCRA it upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Government have worked to make \u00a7203 as user-friendly as possible.  For instance, Congress established a special mechanism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see note following 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7437h; the FEC has established a standardized process, with clearly defined safe harbors, for corporations to claim that a particular electioneering communication is permissible under WRTL, see 11 CFR \u00a7114.15 (2009);[Footnote 27] and, as noted above, The Chief Justice crafted his controlling opinion in WRTL with the express goal of maximizing clarity and administrability, 551 U. S., at 469\u2013470, 473\u2013474.  The case for stare decisis may be bolstered, we have said, when subsequent rulings \u201chave reduced the impact\u201d of a precedent \u201cwhile reaffirming the decision\u2019s core ruling.\u201d  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).[Footnote 28]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, the Court\u2019s rejection of Austin and McConnell comes down to nothing more than its disagreement with their results.  Virtually every one of its arguments was made and rejected in those cases, and the majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents.  The only relevant thing that has changed since Austin and McConnell is the composition of this Court.  Today\u2019s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of stare decisis, \u201cthe means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion\u201d that \u201cpermits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.\u201d  Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986).\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The novelty of the Court\u2019s procedural dereliction and its approach to stare decisis is matched by the novelty of its ruling on the merits.  The ruling rests on several premises.  First, the Court claims that Austin and McConnell have \u201cbanned\u201d corporate speech.  Second, it claims that the First Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on speaker identity, including the speaker\u2019s identity as a corporation.  Third, it claims that Austin and McConnell were radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our campaign finance jurisprudence.  Each of these claims is wrong.\nThe So-Called \u201cBan\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pervading the Court\u2019s analysis is the ominous image of a \u201ccategorical ba[n]\u201d on corporate speech.  Ante, at 45.  Indeed, the majority invokes the specter of a \u201cban\u201d on nearly every page of its opinion.  Ante, at 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45, 46, 47, 49, 54, 56.  This characterization is highly misleading, and needs to be corrected.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact it already has been.  Our cases have repeatedly pointed out that, \u201c[c]ontrary to the [majority\u2019s] critical assumptions,\u201d the statutes upheld in Austin and McConnell do \u201cnot impose an absolute ban on all forms of corporate political spending.\u201d  Austin, 494 U. S., at 660; see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 203\u2013204; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 162\u2013163.  For starters, both statutes provide exemptions for PACs, separate segregated funds established by a corporation for political purposes.  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(2)(C); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7169.255 (West 2005).  \u201cThe ability to form and administer separate segregated funds,\u201d we observed in McConnell, \u201chas provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.  That has been this Court\u2019s unanimous view.\u201d  540 U. S., at 203.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under BCRA, any corporation\u2019s \u201cstockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families\u201d can pool their resources to finance electioneering communications.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(4)(A)(i).  A significant and growing number of corporations avail themselves of this option;[Footnote 29] during the most recent election cycle, corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion dollars.[Footnote 30]  Administering a PAC entails some administrative burden, but so does complying with the disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds, see ante, at 51, and no one has suggested that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for-profit corporation.  To the extent the majority is worried about this issue, it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is, just the majority\u2019s own unsupported factfinding, see ante, at 21\u201322.  Like all other natural persons, every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under Austin and McConnell to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form.  The owners of a \u201cmom & pop\u201d store can simply place ads in their own names, rather than the store\u2019s.  If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form, they may utilize an MCFL organization that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit for business or union interests.  See MCFL, 479 U. S., at 263\u2013264.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The laws upheld in Austin and McConnell leave open many additional avenues for corporations\u2019 political speech.  Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluating in this case, BCRA \u00a7203.  It has no application to genuine issue advertising\u2014a category of corporate speech Congress found to be far more substantial than election-related advertising, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207\u2014or to Internet, telephone, and print advocacy.[Footnote 31]  Like numerous statutes, it exempts media companies\u2019 news stories, commentaries, and editorials from its electioneering restrictions, in recognition of the unique role played by the institutional press in sustaining public debate.[Footnote 32]  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7434(f)(3)(B)(i); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 208\u2013209; see also Austin, 494 U. S., at 666\u2013668.  It also allows corporations to spend unlimited sums on political communications with their executives and shareholders, \u00a7441b(b)(2)(A); 11 CFR \u00a7114.3(a)(1), to fund additional PAC activity through trade associations, 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(4)(D), to distribute voting guides and voting records, 11 CFR \u00a7\u00a7114.4(c)(4)\u2013(5), to underwrite voter registration and voter turnout activities, \u00a7114.3(c)(4); \u00a7114.4(c)(2), to host fundraising events for candidates within certain limits, \u00a7114.4(c); \u00a7114.2(f)(2), and to publicly endorse candidates through a press release and press conference, \u00a7114.4(c)(6).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time Citizens United brought this lawsuit, the only types of speech that could be regulated under \u00a7203 were: (1) broadcast, cable, or satellite communications;[Footnote 33] (2) capable of reaching at least 50,000 persons in the relevant electorate;[Footnote 34] (3) made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general federal election;[Footnote 35] (4) by a labor union or a non-MCFL, nonmedia corporation;[Footnote 36] (5) paid for with general treasury funds;[Footnote 37] and (6) \u201csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\u201d[Footnote 38]  The category of communications meeting all of these criteria is not trivial, but the notion that corporate political speech has been \u201csuppress[ed] \u2026 altogether,\u201d ante, at 2, that corporations have been \u201cexclu[ded] \u2026 from the general public dialogue,\u201d ante, at 25, or that a work of fiction such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington might be covered, ante, at 56\u201357, is nonsense.[Footnote 39]  Even the plaintiffs in McConnell, who had every incentive to depict BCRA as negatively as possible, declined to argue that \u00a7203\u2019s prohibition on certain uses of general treasury funds amounts to a complete ban.  See 540 U. S., at 204.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In many ways, then, \u00a7203 functions as a source restriction or a time, place, and manner restriction.  It applies in a viewpoint-neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office, made during discrete time periods through discrete channels.  In the case at hand, all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast Hillary right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC, which by its own account is \u201cone of the most active conservative PACs in America,\u201d Citizens United Political Victory Fund, http://www.cupvf.org/.[Footnote 40]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So let us be clear: Neither Austin nor McConnell held or implied that corporations may be silenced; the FEC is not a \u201ccensor\u201d; and in the years since these cases were decided, corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue.  Laws such as \u00a7203 target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process, that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens, and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it.  Such laws burden political speech, and that is always a serious matter, demanding careful scrutiny.  But the majority\u2019s incessant talk of a \u201cban\u201d aims at a straw man.\nIdentity-Based Distinctions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second pillar of the Court\u2019s opinion is its assertion that \u201cthe Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker\u2019s \u2026 identity.\u201d  Ante, at 30; accord, ante, at 1, 24, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 49, 50.  The case on which it relies for this proposition is First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978).  As I shall explain, infra, at 52\u201355, the holding in that case was far narrower than the Court implies.  Like its paeans to unfettered discourse, the Court\u2019s denunciation of identity-based distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures reality.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cOur jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation\u201d of the First Amendment.  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).  The First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d  Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the press, that text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind.  Yet in a variety of contexts, we have held that speech can be regulated differentially on account of the speaker\u2019s identity, when identity is understood in categorical or institutional terms.  The Government routinely places special restrictions on the speech rights of students,[Footnote 41] prisoners,[Footnote 42] members of the Armed Forces,[Footnote 43] foreigners,[Footnote 44] and its own employees.[Footnote 45]  When such restrictions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest, they do not necessarily raise constitutional problems.[Footnote 46]  In contrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses, our cases recognize that the Government\u2019s interests may be more or less compelling with respect to different classes of speakers,[Footnote 47] cf. Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585 (1983) (\u201c[D]ifferential treatment\u201d is constitutionally suspect \u201cunless justified by some special characteristic\u201d of the regulated class of speakers (emphasis added)), and that the constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers, in certain contexts, \u201c\u00a0\u2018are not automatically coextensive with the rights\u2019\u00a0\u201d that are normally accorded to members of our society, Morse v. Frederick, 551 U. S. 393, 396\u2013397, 404 (2007) (quoting Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 682 (1986)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The free speech guarantee thus does not render every other public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a speaker\u2019s autonomy; society could scarcely function if it did.  It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine has \u201cfrowned on\u201d certain identity-based distinctions, Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 47, n.\u00a04 (1999) (Stevens, J., dissenting), particularly those that may reflect invidious discrimination or preferential treatment of a politically powerful group.  But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or content.  Not even close.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The election context is distinctive in many ways, and the Court, of course, is right that the First Amendment closely guards political speech.  But in this context, too, the authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint-neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled.  We have, for example, allowed state-run broadcasters to exclude independent candidates from televised debates.  Arkansas Ed. Television Comm\u2019n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666 (1998).[Footnote 48]  We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distribution or display of campaign materials near a polling place.  Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191 (1992).[Footnote 49]  Although we have not reviewed them directly, we have never cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nationals.  See, e.g., 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441e(a)(1).  And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees, but not others, from contributing to or participating in political activities.  See n.\u00a045, supra.  These statutes burden the political expression of one class of speakers, namely, civil servants.  Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and Congress\u2019 reasoned judgment that certain regulations which leave \u201cuntouched full participation \u2026 in political decisions at the ballot box,\u201d Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 556 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), help ensure that public officials are \u201csufficiently free from improper influences,\u201d id., at 564, and that \u201cconfidence in the system of representative Government is not \u2026 eroded to a disastrous extent,\u201d id., at 565.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same logic applies to this case with additional force because it is the identity of corporations, rather than individuals, that the Legislature has taken into account.  As we have unanimously observed, legislatures are entitled to decide \u201cthat the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation\u201d in an electoral context.  NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210.[Footnote 50]  Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized, but within the area of campaign finance, corporate spending is also \u201cfurthest from the core of political expression, since corporations\u2019 First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information,\u201d Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 161, n.\u00a08 (citation omitted).  Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome, in other words, because the \u201cspeakers\u201d are not natural persons, much less members of our political community, and the governmental interests are of the highest order.  Furthermore, when corporations, as a class, are distinguished from noncorporations, as a class, there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimination or political favoritism. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If taken seriously, our colleagues\u2019 assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government\u2019s ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions.  Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by \u201cTokyo Rose\u201d during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders.  More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \u201c\u00a0\u2018enhance the relative voice\u2019\u00a0\u201d of some (i.e., humans) over others (i.e., nonhumans).  Ante, at 33 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49).[Footnote 51]  Under the majority\u2019s view, I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote, given that voting is, among other things, a form of speech.[Footnote 52]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the Court dramatically overstates its critique of identity-based distinctions, without ever explaining why corporate identity demands the same treatment as individual identity.  Only the most wooden approach to the First Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it seeks to draw.\nOur First Amendment Tradition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A third fulcrum of the Court\u2019s opinion is the idea that Austin and McConnell are radical outliers, \u201caberration[s],\u201d in our First Amendment tradition.  Ante, at 39; see also ante, at 45, 56 (professing fidelity to \u201cour law and our tradition\u201d).  The Court has it exactly backwards.  It is today\u2019s holding that is the radical departure from what had been settled First Amendment law.  To see why, it is useful to take a long view.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Original Understandings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let us start from the beginning.  The Court invokes \u201cancient First Amendment principles,\u201d ante, at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted), and original understandings, ante, at 37\u201338, to defend today\u2019s ruling, yet it makes only a perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the principles or understandings of those who drafted and ratified the Amendment.  Perhaps this is because there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed it would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form.  To the extent that the Framers\u2019 views are discernible and relevant to the disposition of this case, they would appear to cut strongly against the majority\u2019s position.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not only because the Framers and their contemporaries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now think of it, see Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L.\u00a0J. 1, 22 (1971), but also because they held very different views about the nature of the First Amendment right and the role of corporations in society.  Those few corporations that existed at the founding were authorized by grant of a special legislative charter.[Footnote 53]  Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature, and the legislature, if amenable, would issue a charter that specified the corporation\u2019s powers and purposes and \u201cauthoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate organization,\u201d including \u201cthe internal structure of the corporation.\u201d  J. Hurst, The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States 1780\u20131970, pp.\u00a015\u201316 (1970) (reprint 2004).  Corporations were created, supervised, and conceptualized as quasi-public entities, \u201cdesigned to serve a social function for the state.\u201d  Handlin & Handlin, Origin of the American Business Corporation, 5 J. Econ. Hist. 1, 22 (1945).  It was \u201cassumed that [they] were legally privileged organizations that had to be closely scrutinized by the legislature because their purposes had to be made consistent with public welfare.\u201d  R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784\u20131855, p.\u00a05 (1982).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The individualized charter mode of incorporation reflected the \u201ccloud of disfavor under which corporations labored\u201d in the early years of this Nation.  1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \u00a72, p.\u00a08 (rev. ed. 2006); see also Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee, 288 U. S. 517, 548\u2013549 (1933) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (discussing fears of the \u201cevils\u201d of business corporations); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed. 1985) (\u201cThe word \u2018soulless\u2019 constantly recurs in debates over corporations\u2026\u00a0. Corporations, it was feared, could concentrate the worst urges of whole groups of men\u201d).  Thomas Jefferson famously fretted that corporations would subvert the Republic.[Footnote 54]  General incorporation statutes, and widespread acceptance of business corporations as socially useful actors, did not emerge until the 1800\u2019s.  See Hansmann & Kraakman, The End of History for Corporate Law, 89 Geo. L.\u00a0J. 439, 440 (2001) (hereinafter Hansmann & Kraakman) (\u201c[A]ll general business corporation statutes appear to date from well after 1800\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively regulated in the service of the public welfare.  Unlike our colleagues, they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.[Footnote 55]  While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights, business corporations, at least, were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends.  Even \u201cthe notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty,\u201d given that \u201cat the time, the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign.\u201d  Shelledy, Autonomy, Debate, and Corporate Speech, 18 Hastings Const. L.\u00a0Q. 541, 578 (1991); cf. Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 636 (1819) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.) (\u201cA corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law.  Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it\u201d); Eule, Promoting Speaker Diversity: Austin and Metro Broadcasting, 1990 S. Ct. Rev. 105, 129 (\u201cThe framers of the First Amendment could scarcely have anticipated its application to the corporation form.  That, of course, ought not to be dispositive.  What is compelling, however, is an understanding of who was supposed to be the beneficiary of the free speech guaranty\u2014the individual\u201d).  In light of these background practices and understandings, it seems to me implausible that the Framers believed \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d would extend equally to all corporate speakers, much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to guard against corporate capture of elections.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse intellectual sources, communicated through newspapers, and aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed in England.  Ante, at 37.  From these (accurate) observations, the Court concludes that \u201c[t]he First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society\u2019s most salient media.\u201d  Ibid.  This conclusion is far from certain, given that many historians believe the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication and did not understand the First Amendment to \u201cprevent the subsequent punishment of such [publications] as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.\u201d  Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 714 (1931).  Yet, even if the majority\u2019s conclusion were correct, it would tell us only that the First Amendment was understood to protect political speech in certain media.  It would tell us little about whether the Amendment was understood to protect general treasury electioneering expenditures by corporations, and to what extent. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of original expectations, then, it seems absurd to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor of electoral advocacy.  As a matter of original meaning, it likewise seems baseless\u2014unless one evaluates the First Amendment\u2019s \u201cprinciples,\u201d ante, at 1, 48, or its \u201cpurpose,\u201d ante, at 5 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.), at such a high level of generality that the historical understandings of the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judicial task.  This case sheds a revelatory light on the assumption of some that an impartial judge\u2019s application of an originalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate answers, or to play a more decisive role in the decisional process, than his or her views about sound policy.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Scalia criticizes the foregoing discussion for failing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that corporations were understood to be excluded from the First Amendment\u2019s free speech guarantee.  Ante, at 1\u20132, 9.  Of course, Justice Scalia adduces no statements to suggest the contrary proposition, or even to suggest that the contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right that the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause thought they were enshrining.  Although Justice Scalia makes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual\u2019s right to speak entails a right to speak with others for a common cause, cf. MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, he does not explain why those two rights must be precisely identical, or why that principle applies to electioneering by corporations that serve no \u201ccommon cause.\u201d  Ante, at 8.  Nothing in his account dislodges my basic point that members of the founding generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of corporate rights (not that they \u201cdespised\u201d corporations, ante, at 2), and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms.  If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech, that may well be because the contrary proposition\u2014if not also the very notion of \u201ccorporate speech\u201d\u2014was inconceivable.[Footnote 56]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Scalia also emphasizes the unqualified nature of the First Amendment text.  Ante, at 2, 8.  Yet he would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause: How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally?  Ante, at 6.[Footnote 57]  Like virtually all modern lawyers, Justice Scalia presumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Executive, even though its language refers to Congress alone.  In any event, the text only leads us back to the questions who or what is guaranteed \u201cthe freedom of speech,\u201d and, just as critically, what that freedom consists of and under what circumstances it may be limited.  Justice Scalia appears to believe that because corporations are created and utilized by individuals, it follows (as night the day) that their electioneering must be equally protected by the First Amendment and equally immunized from expenditure limits.  See ante, at 7\u20138.  That conclusion certainly does not follow as a logical matter, and Justice Scalia fails to explain why the original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA \u00a7203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amendment.[Footnote 58]  I have given several reasons why I believe the Constitution would have been understood then, and ought to be understood now, to permit reasonable restrictions on corporate electioneering, and I will give many more reasons in the pages to come.  The Court enlists the Framers in its defense without seriously grappling with their understandings of corporations or the free speech right, or with the republican principles that underlay those understandings.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fairness, our campaign finance jurisprudence has never attended very closely to the views of the Framers, see Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 280 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting), whose political universe differed profoundly from that of today.  We have long since held that corporations are covered by the First Amendment, and many legal scholars have long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation.  But \u201chistorical context is usually relevant,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), and in light of the Court\u2019s effort to cast itself as guardian of ancient values, it pays to remember that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today\u2019s outcome.  To the contrary, this history helps illuminate just how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is.\n2.  Legislative and Judicial Interpretation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today\u2019s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition.  At the federal level, the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907, when Congress passed the Tillman Act, ch. 420, 34 Stat. 864, banning all corporate contributions to candidates.  The Senate Report on the legislation observed that \u201c[t]he evils of the use of [corporate] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure.  It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials.\u201d  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 3056, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1906).  President Roosevelt, in his 1905 annual message to Congress, declared:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders\u2019 money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 572 (1957) (quoting 40 Cong. Rec. 96).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the Tillman Act several times, see WRTL, 551 U. S., at 508\u2013510 (Souter, J., dissenting); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 115; Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 570\u2013575, and I will refrain from doing so again.  It is enough to say that the Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns: first, the enormous power corporations had come to wield in federal elections, with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and a public perception of corruption; and second, a respect for the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the use of their money to support candidates they opposed.  See ibid.; United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 113 (1948); Winkler, \u201cOther People\u2019s Money\u201d: Corporations, Agency Costs, and Campaign Finance Law, 92 Geo. L.\u00a0J. 871 (2004).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the years, the limitations on corporate political spending have been modified in a number of ways, as Congress responded to changes in the American economy and political practices that threatened to displace the commonweal.  Justice Souter recently traced these developments at length.[Footnote 59]  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 507\u2013519 (dissenting opinion); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 115\u2013133; McConnell, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 188\u2013205.  The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case.  In that Act passed more than 60 years ago, Congress extended the prohibition on corporate support of candidates to cover not only direct contributions, but independent expenditures as well.  Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, \u00a7304, 61 Stat. 159.  The bar on contributions \u201cwas being so narrowly construed\u201d that corporations were easily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting candidates through other means.  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing S.\u00a0Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38\u201339 (1947)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century, several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions, even though the Court declined to pass on its constitutionality.  Ante, at 27\u201328.  Two features of these cases are of far greater relevance.  First, those Justices were writing separately; which is to say, their position failed to command a majority.  Prior to today, this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents.  Second, each case in this line expressed support for the principle that corporate and union political speech financed with PAC funds, collected voluntarily from the organization\u2019s stockholders or members, receives greater protection than speech financed with general treasury funds.[Footnote 60]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 86 Stat. 3, which retained the restriction on using general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures, 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(a).  FECA codified the option for corporations and unions to create PACs to finance contributions and expenditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself.  \u00a7441b(b).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971, the bar on corporate contributions and expenditures had become such an accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation that when a large number of plaintiffs, including several nonprofit corporations, challenged virtually every aspect of the Act in Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, no one even bothered to argue that the bar as such was unconstitutional.  Buckley famously (or infamously) distinguished direct contributions from independent expenditures, id., at 58\u201359, but its silence on corporations only reinforced the understanding that corporate expenditures could be treated differently from individual expenditures.  \u201cSince our decision in Buckley, Congress\u2019 power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 203.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, it was unremarkable, in a 1982 case holding that Congress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting nonmembers for PAC funds, that then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court that Congress\u2019 \u201ccareful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws, in a cautious advance, step by step, to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations \u2026 warrants considerable deference,\u201d and \u201creflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process.\u201d  NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \u201cThe governmental interest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected representatives has long been recognized,\u201d the unanimous Court observed, \u201cand there is no reason why it may not \u2026 be accomplished by treating \u2026 corporations \u2026 differently from individuals.\u201d  Id., at 210\u2013211.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The corporate/individual distinction was not questioned by the Court\u2019s disposition, in 1986, of a challenge to the expenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonprofit corporation.  In MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, we stated again \u201cthat \u2018the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 256 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210), and again we acknowledged that the Government has a legitimate interest in \u201cregulat[ing] the substantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form,\u201d 479 U. S., at 257 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Those aggregations can distort the \u201cfree trade in ideas\u201d crucial to candidate elections, ibid., at the expense of members or shareholders who may disagree with the object of the expenditures, id., at 260 (internal quotation marks omitted).  What the Court held by a 5-to-4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures, because Congress\u2019 interests in protecting shareholders and \u201crestrict[ing] \u2018the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 257 (quoting FEC v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 501 (1985) (NCPAC)), did not apply to corporations that were structurally insulated from those concerns.[Footnote 61]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is worth remembering for present purposes that the four MCFL dissenters, led by Chief Justice Rehnquist, thought the Court was carrying the First Amendment too far.  They would have recognized congressional authority to bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by this class of nonprofits; they acknowledged that \u201cthe threat from corporate political activity will vary depending on the particular characteristics of a given corporation,\u201d but believed these \u201cdistinctions among corporations\u201d were \u201cdistinctions in degree,\u201d not \u201cin kind,\u201d and thus \u201cmore properly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary.\u201d  479 U. S., at 268 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of corporate political speech could be no more stringent than of speech by an individual.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four years later, in Austin, 494 U. S. 652, we considered whether corporations falling outside the MCFL exception could be barred from using general treasury funds to make independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates.  We held they could be.  Once again recognizing the importance of \u201cthe integrity of the marketplace of political ideas\u201d in candidate elections, MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257, we noted that corporations have \u201cspecial advantages\u2014such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets,\u201d 494 U. S., at 658\u2013659\u2014that allow them to spend prodigious general treasury sums on campaign messages that have \u201clittle or no correlation\u201d with the beliefs held by actual persons, id., at 660.  In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have on the political process, ibid., we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations\u2019 PACs, which rely on voluntary contributions and thus \u201creflect actual public support for the political ideals espoused by corporations,\u201d ibid.  Notwithstanding our colleagues\u2019 insinuations that Austin deprived the public of general \u201cideas,\u201d \u201cfacts,\u201d and \u201cknowledge,\u201d ante, at 38\u201339, the decision addressed only candidate-focused expenditures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate spending on other matters. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 20 years since Austin, we have reaffirmed its holding and rationale a number of times, see, e.g., Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 153\u2013156, most importantly in McConnell, 540 U. S. 93, where we upheld the provision challenged here, \u00a7203 of BCRA.[Footnote 62]  Congress crafted \u00a7203 in response to a problem created by Buckley.  The Buckley Court had construed FECA\u2019s definition of prohibited \u201cexpenditures\u201d narrowly to avoid any problems of constitutional vagueness, holding it applicable only to \u201ccommunications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,\u201d 424 U. S., at 80, i.e., statements containing so-called \u201cmagic words\u201d like \u201c\u00a0\u2018vote for,\u2019 \u2018elect,\u2019 \u2018support,\u2019 \u2018cast your ballot for,\u2019 \u2018Smith for Congress,\u2019 \u2018vote against,\u2019 \u2018defeat,\u2019 [or] \u2018reject,\u2019\u00a0\u201d id., at 43\u201344, and n. 52.  After Buckley, corporations and unions figured out how to circumvent the limits on express advocacy by using sham \u201cissue ads\u201d that \u201ceschewed the use of magic words\u201d but nonetheless \u201cadvocate[d] the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 126.  \u201cCorporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads.\u201d  Id., at 127.  Congress passed \u00a7203 to address this circumvention, prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for electioneering communications that \u201crefe[r] to a clearly identified candidate,\u201d whether or not those communications use the magic words.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A)(i)(I).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we asked in McConnell \u201cwhether a compelling governmental interest justifie[d]\u201d \u00a7203, we found the question \u201ceasily answered\u201d: \u201cWe have repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at \u2018the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin, 494 U. S., at 660).  These precedents \u201crepresent respect for the legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation.\u201d  540 U. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201cMoreover, recent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against \u2018\u00a0\u201ccircumvention of [valid] contribution limits.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 155, in turn quoting FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 456, and n.\u00a018 (2001) (Colorado II); alteration in original).  BCRA, we found, is faithful to the compelling governmental interests in \u201c\u00a0\u2018preserving the integrity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, \u2026 sustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of the government,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and maintaining \u201c\u00a0\u2018the individual citizen\u2019s confidence in government.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  540 U. S., at 206\u2013207, n.\u00a088 (quoting Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 788\u2013789; some internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  What made the answer even easier than it might have been otherwise was the option to form PACs, which give corporations, at the least, \u201ca constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in\u201d independent expenditures.  540 U. S., at 203.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buckley and Bellotti\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against this extensive background of congressional regulation of corporate campaign spending, and our repeated affirmation of this regulation as constitutionally sound, the majority dismisses Austin as \u201ca significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\u201d ante, at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).  How does the majority attempt to justify this claim?  Selected passages from two cases, Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, and Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, do all of the work.  In the Court\u2019s view, Buckley and Bellotti decisively rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from natural persons in the 1970\u2019s; it just so happens that in every single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign finance legislation in the decades since, the majority failed to grasp this truth.  The Federal Congress and dozens of state legislatures, we now know, have been similarly deluded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority emphasizes Buckley\u2019s statement that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 33 (quoting 424 U. S., at 48\u201349); ante, at 8 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).  But this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it.  For one thing, the Constitution does, in fact, permit numerous \u201crestrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many\u201d: for example, restrictions on ballot access and on legislators\u2019 floor time.  Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).  For another, the Buckley Court used this line in evaluating \u201cthe ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d  424 U. S., at 48.  It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case before us.  The majority suggests that Austin rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization, ante, at 34; ante, at 8\u201310 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.), but we made it clear in Austin (as in several cases before and since) that a restriction on the way corporations spend their money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of some elements of our society in preference to others.  Indeed, we expressly ruled that the compelling interest supporting Michigan\u2019s statute was not one of \u201c\u00a0\u2018equaliz[ing] the relative influence of speakers on elections,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Austin, 494 U. S., at 660 (quoting id., at 705 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)), but rather the need to confront the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy financed by general treasury dollars, id., at 659\u2013660.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that matter, it should go without saying that when we made this statement in Buckley, we could not have been casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expenditures in candidate elections, which had not been challenged as \u201cforeign to the First Amendment,\u201d ante, at 33 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49), or for any other reason.  Buckley\u2019s independent expenditure analysis was focused on a very different statutory provision, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  It is implausible to think, as the majority suggests, ante, at 29\u201330, that Buckley covertly invalidated FECA\u2019s separate corporate and union campaign expenditure restriction, \u00a7610 (now codified at 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b), even though that restriction had been on the books for decades before Buckley and would remain on the books, undisturbed, for decades after.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case on which the majority places even greater weight than Buckley, however, is Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, claiming it \u201ccould not have been clearer\u201d that Bellotti\u2019s holding forbade distinctions between corporate and individual expenditures like the one at issue here, ante, at 30.  The Court\u2019s reliance is odd.  The only thing about Bellotti that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority\u2019s position.  Bellotti ruled, in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding, that \u201cour consideration of a corporation\u2019s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\u201d  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26; see also id., at 787\u2013788 (acknowledging that the interests in preserving public confidence in Government and protecting dissenting shareholders may be \u201cweighty \u2026 in the context of partisan candidate elections\u201d).  Bellotti, in other words, did not touch the question presented in Austin and McConnell, and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority attempts to explain away the distinction Bellotti drew\u2014between general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office\u2014as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with Buckley.  Ante, at 31, 42\u201344.  Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent: The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections, the \u201cimportance\u201d of which \u201chas never been doubted,\u201d 435 U. S., at 788, n.\u00a026, do not apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda.  A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a corporation, or fear the corporation\u2019s retaliation.  Cf. Austin, 494 U. S., at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring); Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 299 (1981).  The majority likewise overlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases have repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinction.  See, e.g., Austin, 494 U. S., at 659; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 495\u2013496; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 371, n.\u00a09 (1984); NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210, n.\u00a07.  The Court\u2019s critique of Bellotti\u2019s footnote 26 puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate Bellotti to canonical status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with Buckley.  Bellotti, apparently, is both the font of all wisdom and internally incoherent.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case: a state statute that barred business corporations\u2019 expenditures on some referenda but not others.  Specifically, the statute barred a business corporation \u201cfrom making contributions or expenditures \u2018for the purpose of \u2026 influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 55, \u00a78 (West Supp. 1977); alteration in original), and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not \u201c\u00a0\u2018be deemed materially to affect the property, business or assets of the corporation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 435 U. S., at 768.  As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax.  The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters.  See id., at 769\u2013770, and n.\u00a03.  We said that \u201cwhere, as here, the legislature\u2019s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended.\u201d  Id., at 785\u2013786 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint-discriminatory statute, created to effect a particular policy outcome.  Even Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that \u201ca very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massachusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth\u2019s referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax, simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire.\u201d  Id., at 827, n.\u00a06.  To make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs.  Id., at 768, n.\u00a02 (opinion of the Court).  This really was a complete ban on a specific, preidentified subject.  See MCFL, 479 U. S., at 259, n.\u00a012 (stating that 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure restriction \u201cis of course distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in the state referendum context in \u2026 Bellotti\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority grasps a quotational straw from Bellotti, that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corporation.  Ante, at 30\u201331.  Of course not, but no one suggests the contrary and neither Austin nor McConnell held otherwise.  They held that even though the expenditures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny, the restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a compelling state interest.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 205; Austin, 494 U. S., at 658, 660.  We acknowledged in Bellotti that numerous \u201cinterests of the highest importance\u201d can justify campaign finance regulation.  435 U. S., at 788\u2013789.  But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law.  Id., at 789.  We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been \u201crecord or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin and McConnell, then, sit perfectly well with Bellotti.  Indeed, all six Members of the Austin majority had been on the Court at the time of Bellotti, and none so much as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension between the decisions.  The difference between the cases is not that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it.  The difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda, because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to \u201c\u00a0\u2018[p]reserv[e] the integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, \u2026 sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual citizen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d protect the expressive interests of shareholders, and \u201c\u00a0\u2018[p]reserv[e] \u2026 the individual citizen\u2019s confidence in government.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 206\u2013207, n.\u00a088 (quoting Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 788\u2013789; first alteration in original).  These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907, see Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 570\u2013575, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, see WRTL, 551 U. S., at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting), FECA in 1971, see NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210, and BCRA in 2002, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 126\u2013132.  Continuously for over 100 years, this line of \u201c[c]ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries.\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Time and again, we have recognized these realities in approving measures that Congress and the States have taken.  None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary.  The only thing new about Austin was the dissent, with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in which to revisit Austin and McConnell and why these decisions sit perfectly well with \u201cFirst Amendment principles,\u201d ante, at 1, 48, I come at last to the interests that are at stake.  The majority recognizes that Austin and McConnell may be defended on anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales.  Ante, at 32\u201346.  It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales, which overlap and complement each other, and in applying them to the case at hand.\nThe Anticorruption Interest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Undergirding the majority\u2019s approach to the merits is the claim that the only \u201csufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption\u201d is one that is \u201climited to quid pro quo corruption.\u201d  Ante, at 43.  This is the same \u201ccrabbed view of corruption\u201d that was espoused by Justice Kennedy in McConnell and squarely rejected by the Court in that case.  540 U. S., at 152.  While it is true that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the approach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my judgment.  It disregards our constitutional history and the fundamental demands of a democratic society.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress\u2019 legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an \u201c\u00a0\u2018undue influence on an officeholder\u2019s judgment\u2019\u00a0\u201d and from creating \u201c\u00a0\u2018the appearance of such influence,\u2019\u00a0\u201d beyond the sphere of quid pro quo relationships.  Id., at 150; see also, e.g., id., at 143\u2013144, 152\u2013154; Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441; Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 389.  Corruption can take many forms.  Bribery may be the paradigm case.  But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind.  And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one\u2019s behalf.  Corruption operates along a spectrum, and the majority\u2019s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics.  It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may go about scratching each other\u2019s backs\u2014and which amply supported Congress\u2019 determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record.  In a careful analysis, Judge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the corrupting consequences of corporate and union independent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA\u2019s passage.  See McConnell, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 555\u2013560, 622\u2013625; see also id., at 804\u2013805, 813, n.\u00a0143 (Leon, J.) (indicating agreement).  As summarized in her own words:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members\u2019 elections.  The record also indicates that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election-related advertisements.  Indeed, Members of Congress are particularly grateful when negative issue advertisements are run by these organizations, leaving the candidates free to run positive advertisements and be seen as \u2018above the fray.\u2019  Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate\u2019s behalf, when they are being run, and where they are being run.  Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Findings also demonstrate that Members of Congress seek to have corporations and unions run these advertisements on their behalf.  The Findings show that Members suggest that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups with the understanding that the money contributed to these groups will assist the Member in a campaign.  After the election, these organizations often seek credit for their support\u2026\u00a0. Finally, a large majority of Americans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications, which benefit specific elected officials, receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations.\u201d  Id., at 623\u2013624 (citations and footnote omitted).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge Kollar-Kotelly seemed to have a quid pro quo basis, but other arrangements were more subtle.  Her analysis shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of the quid pro quo category, as well as the adverse consequences that all such arrangements may have.  There are threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society than the odd bribe.  Yet the majority\u2019s understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but the most discrete abuses.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our \u201cundue influence\u201d cases have allowed the American people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, \u201cthat officeholders will decide issues \u2026 on the merits or the desires of their constituencies,\u201d and not \u201caccording to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions\u201d\u2014or expenditures\u2014\u201cvalued by the officeholder.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 153.[Footnote 63]  When private interests are seen to exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account of the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns, the result can depart so thoroughly \u201cfrom what is pure or correct\u201d in the conduct of Government, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 512 (1966) (defining \u201ccorruption\u201d), that it amounts to a \u201csubversion \u2026 of the electoral process,\u201d Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 575.  At stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Government but also the public\u2019s faith therein, not only \u201cthe capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents [but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves,\u201d WRTL, 551 U. S.,  at 507 (Souter, J., dissenting).  \u201cTake away Congress\u2019 authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and \u2018the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390).[Footnote 64] \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cluster of interrelated interests threatened by such undue influence and its appearance has been well captured under the rubric of \u201cdemocratic integrity.\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 522 (Souter, J., dissenting).  This value has underlined a century of state and federal efforts to regulate the role of corporations in the electoral process.[Footnote 65]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the majority\u2019s myopic focus on quid pro quo scenarios and the free-floating \u201cFirst Amendment principles\u201d on which it rests so much weight, ante, at 1, 48, this broader understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation\u2019s history.  \u201cDuring debates on the earliest [campaign finance] reform acts, the terms \u2018corruption\u2019 and \u2018undue influence\u2019 were used nearly interchangeably.\u201d  Pasquale, Reclaiming Egalitarianism in the Political Theory of Campaign Finance Reform, 2008 U. Ill. L.\u00a0Rev. 599, 601.  Long before Buckley, we appreciated that \u201c[t]o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard \u2026 an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection.\u201d  Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 545 (1934).  And whereas we have no evidence to support the notion that the Framers would have wanted corporations to have the same rights as natural persons in the electoral context, we have ample evidence to suggest that they would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance.  It is fair to say that \u201c[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,\u201d Teachout 348, which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests, see id., at 373\u2013374; see also Randall, 548 U. S., at 280 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  They discussed corruption \u201cmore often in the Constitutional Convention than factions, violence, or instability.\u201d  Teachout 352.  When they brought our constitutional order into being, the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self-government that this Court has lost sight of.\nQuid Pro Quo Corruption\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no need to take my side in the debate over the scope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court\u2019s merits holding is wrong.  Even under the majority\u2019s \u201ccrabbed view of corruption,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 152, the Government should not lose this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption through the creation of political debts] has never been doubted.\u201d  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 788, n.\u00a026.  Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption interest most narrowly, we have never suggested that such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct crimes.  Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of, some outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 143 (\u201cWe have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges.  In Buckley, we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA\u2019s contribution limits, noting that such laws \u2018deal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting 424 U. S., at 28; alteration in original)).  It has likewise never been doubted that \u201c[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption.\u201d  Id., at 27.  Congress may \u201clegitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical \u2026 if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.\u201d  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In theory, our colleagues accept this much.  As applied to BCRA \u00a7203, however, they conclude \u201c[t]he anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.\u201d  Ante, at 41.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court suggests that Buckley compels its conclusion, ante, at 40\u201344, Buckley cannot sustain this reading.  It is true that, in evaluating FECA\u2019s ceiling on independent expenditures by all persons, the Buckley Court found the governmental interest in preventing corruption \u201cinadequate.\u201d  424 U. S., at 45.  But Buckley did not evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it rule out the possibility that a future Court might find otherwise.  The opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering only express advocacy (i.e., magic words) would likely be ineffectual, ibid., a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that \u201cthe independent advocacy restricted by [FECA \u00a7608(e)(1)] does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions,\u201d id., at 46 (emphasis added).  Buckley expressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at a later date, \u201cbecause it may be that, in some circumstances, \u2018large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements as do large contributions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 478 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 45).  Certainly Buckley did not foreclose this possibility with respect to electioneering communications made with corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had no occasion to consider.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Austin Court did not rest its holding on quid pro quo corruption, as it found the broader corruption implicated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a sufficient basis for Michigan\u2019s restriction on corporate electioneering.  494 U. S., at 658\u2013660.  Concurring in that opinion, I took the position that \u201cthe danger of either the fact, or the appearance, of quid pro quo relationships [also] provides an adequate justification for state regulation\u201d of these independent expenditures.  Id., at 678.  I did not see this position as inconsistent with Buckley\u2019s analysis of individual expenditures.  Corporations, as a class, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny; they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy access and votes.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1 trillion during the last election cycle).  Business corporations must engage the political process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value.  The unparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single-minded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make quid pro quo corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups) spend unrestricted sums on elections.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now say that time has borne out my concerns.  The legislative and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corporations grew more and more adept at crafting \u201cissue ads\u201d to help or harm a particular candidate, these nominally independent expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very direct sense.  The sponsors of these ads were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over; \u201ccandidates and officials knew who their friends were,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 129.  Many corporate independent expenditures, it seemed, had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements.  In an age in which money and television ads are the coin of the campaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influence over, public officials.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA record does not contain \u201cdirect examples of votes being exchanged for \u2026 expenditures.\u201d  Ante, at 45 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It would have been quite remarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such behavior by its own Members.  Proving that a specific vote was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been next to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motivations, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote.  Yet, even if \u201c[i]ngratiation and access \u2026 are not corruption\u201d themselves, ibid., they are necessary prerequisites to it; they can create both the opportunity for, and the appearance of, quid pro quo arrangements.  The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of quid pro quo deals: threats, both explicit and implicit.  Starting today, corporations with large war chests to deploy on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their interests.  The majority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record provides \u201conly scant evidence that independent expenditures \u2026 ingratiate,\u201d and that, \u201cin any event,\u201d none of it matters.  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her analysis of the record, Judge Kollar-Kotelly documented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained its significance under the majority\u2019s own touchstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption rationale, Buckley.  See McConnell, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 555\u2013560, 622\u2013625.  Witnesses explained how political parties and candidates used corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA\u2019s \u201chard-money\u201d limitations.  See, e.g., id., at 478\u2013479.  One former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[c]andidates whose campaigns benefit from [phony \u201cissue ads\u201d] greatly appreciate the help of these groups.  In fact, Members will also be favorably disposed to those who finance these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending legislation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers).  One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontroverted testimony, that \u201c\u00a0\u2018unregulated expenditures\u2014whether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad campaigns\u2014can sometimes generate far more influence than direct campaign contributions.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ibid. (quoting declaration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added).  In sum, Judge Kollar-Kotelly found, \u201c[t]he record powerfully demonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with the general treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears those entities to elected officials in a way that could be perceived by the public as corrupting.\u201d  Id., at 622\u2013623.  She concluded that the Government\u2019s interest in preventing the appearance of corruption, as that concept was defined in Buckley, was itself sufficient to uphold BCRA \u00a7203.  251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 622\u2013625.  Judge Leon agreed.  See id., at 804\u2013805 (dissenting only with re-\nspect to the Wellstone Amendment\u2019s coverage of MCFL corporations).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the McConnell Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court regarding \u00a7203, we did not rest our holding on a narrow notion of quid pro quo corruption.  Instead we relied on the governmental interest in combating the unique forms of corruption threatened by corporations, as recognized in Austin\u2019s antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales, 540 U. S., at 205 (citing Austin, 494 U. S., at 660), as well as the interest in preventing circumvention of contribution limits, 540 U. S., at 128\u2013129, 205, 206, n.\u00a088.  Had we felt constrained by the view of today\u2019s Court that quid pro quo corruption and its appearance are the only interests that count in this field, ante, at 32\u201346, we of course would have looked closely at that issue.  And as the analysis by Judge Kollar-Kotelly reflects, it is a very real possibility that we would have found one or both of those interests satisfied and \u00a7203 appropriately tailored to them.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s rejection of the Buckley anticorruption rationale on the ground that independent corporate expenditures \u201cdo not give rise to [quid pro quo] corruption or the appearance of corruption,\u201d ante, at 42, is thus unfair as well as unreasonable.  Congress and outside experts have generated significant evidence corroborating this rationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the relevant materials before us is that the Government had no reason to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge the plaintiff had abandoned.  The Court cannot both sU. S.onte choose to relitigate McConnell on appeal and then complain that the Government has failed to substantiate its case.  If our colleagues were really serious about the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, they would remand to the District Court with instructions to commence evidentiary proceedings.[Footnote 66]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The insight that even technically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions is bolstered by our decision last year in Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  In that case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a corporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Virginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular candidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that court.  \u201cIn addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory maximum to Benjamin\u2019s campaign committee, Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to \u2018And For The Sake Of The Kids,\u2019\u00a0\u201d a \u00a7527 corporation that ran ads targeting Benjamin\u2019s opponent.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  \u201cThis was not all.  Blankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent expenditures \u2026 \u2018\u00a0\u201cto support \u2026 Brent Benjamin.\u201d\u00a0\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2\u20133) (second alteration in original).  Applying its common sense, this Court accepted petitioners\u2019 argument that Blankenship\u2019s \u201cpivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias\u201d when Benjamin later declined to recuse himself from the appeal by Blankenship\u2019s corporation.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  \u201cThough n[o] \u2026 bribe or criminal influence\u201d was involved, we recognized that \u201cJustice Benjamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him elected.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cThe difficulties of inquiring into actual bias,\u201d we further noted, \u201csimply underscore the need for objective rules,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 13)\u2014rules which will perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its actual existence.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Caperton, then, we accepted the premise that, at least in some circumstances, independent expenditures on candidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of quid pro quo corruption.  Indeed, this premise struck the Court as so intuitive that it repeatedly referred to Blankenship\u2019s spending on behalf of Benjamin\u2014spending that consisted of 99.97% independent expenditures ($3 million) and 0.03% direct contributions ($1,000)\u2014as a \u201ccontribution.\u201d  See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (\u201cThe basis for the [recusal] motion was that the justice had received campaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from\u201d Blankenship); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (referencing \u201cBlankenship\u2019s $3 million in contributions\u201d); id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (\u201cBlankenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent and replace him with Benjamin\u201d); id., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\u201cBlankenship\u2019s campaign contributions \u2026 had a significant and disproportionate influence on the electoral outcome\u201d).  The reason the Court so thoroughly conflated expenditures and contributions, one assumes, is that it realized that some expenditures may be functionally equivalent to contributions in the way they influence the outcome of a race, the way they are interpreted by the candidates and the public, and the way they taint the decisions that the officeholder thereafter takes.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Caperton is illuminating in several additional respects.  It underscores the old insight that, on account of the extreme difficulty of proving corruption, \u201cprophylactic measures, reaching some [campaign spending] not corrupt in purpose or effect, [may be] nonetheless required to guard against corruption.\u201d  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 30; see also Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 392, n.\u00a05.  It underscores that \u201ccertain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement\u201d may likewise be needed to \u201chedge against circumvention of valid contribution limits.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 205 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 456 (\u201c[A]ll Members of the Court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption\u201d).  It underscores that for-profit corporations associated with electioneering communications will often prefer to use nonprofit conduits with \u201cmisleading names,\u201d such as And For The Sake Of The Kids, \u201cto conceal their identity\u201d as the sponsor of those communications, thereby frustrating the utility of disclosure laws.  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 128; see also id., at 196\u2013197.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it underscores that the consequences of today\u2019s holding will not be limited to the legislative or executive context.  The majority of the States select their judges through popular elections.  At a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a fever pitch, see, e.g., O\u2019Connor, Justice for Sale, Wall St. Journal, Nov. 15, 2007, p. A25; Brief for Justice at Stake et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 2, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union general treasury spending in these races.  Perhaps \u201cCaperton motions\u201d will catch some of the worst abuses.  This will be small comfort to those States that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.\nDeference and Incumbent Self-Protection\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than show any deference to a coordinate branch of Government, the majority thus rejects the anticorruption rationale without serious analysis.[Footnote 67]  Today\u2019s opinion provides no clear rationale for being so dismissive of Congress, but the prior individual opinions on which it relies have offered one: the incentives of the legislators who passed BCRA.  Section 203, our colleagues have suggested, may be little more than \u201can incumbency protection plan,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 306 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also id., at 249\u2013250, 260\u2013263 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), a disreputable attempt at legislative self-dealing rather than an earnest effort to facilitate First Amendment values and safeguard the legitimacy of our political system.  This possibility, the Court apparently believes, licenses it to run roughshod over Congress\u2019 handiwork.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, we should instead start by acknowledging that \u201cCongress surely has both wisdom and experience in these matters that is far superior to ours.\u201d  Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518 U. S. 604, 650 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Many of our campaign finance precedents explicitly and forcefully affirm the propriety of such presumptive deference.  See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 158; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 155\u2013156; NRWC, 459 U. S., at 209\u2013210.  Moreover, \u201c[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has remained essentially unchanged throughout a century of careful legislative adjustment.\u201d  Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 162, n.\u00a09 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 391 (\u201cThe quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised\u201d).  In America, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern campaign finance, just like all other laws.  To apply a level of scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating electioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self-interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate\nelectioneering.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if there were a solid basis for believing that a legislative action was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents or that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral process.[Footnote 68]  See League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 447 (2006) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 317 (2004) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Along with our duty to balance competing constitutional concerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elections remain at least minimally open, fair, and competitive.  But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress\u2019 years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral competition.  \u201cAbsent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.\u201d  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 31.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have no record evidence from which to conclude that BCRA \u00a7203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the Court today calls into question, reflects or fosters such invidious discrimination.  Our colleagues have opined that \u201c\u00a0\u2018any restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 249 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This kind of airy speculation could easily be turned on its head.  The electioneering prohibited by \u00a7203 might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents have pre-existing relationships with corporations and unions, and groups that wish to procure legislative benefits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting officeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits and is statistically likely to retain office.  If a corporation\u2019s goal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corporation would do well to cultivate stable, long-term relationships of dependency.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So we do not have a solid theoretical basis for condemning \u00a7203 as a front for incumbent self-protection, and it seems equally if not more plausible that restrictions on corporate electioneering will be self-denying.  Nor do we have a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court\u2019s failure to cite any empirical research attests.  Nor does the legislative history give reason for concern.  Congress devoted years of careful study to the issues underlying BCRA; \u201c[f]ew legislative proposals in recent years have received as much sustained public commentary or news coverage\u201d; \u201c[p]olitical scientists and academic experts \u2026 with no self-interest in incumbent protectio[n] were central figures in pressing the case for BCRA\u201d; and the legislation commanded bipartisan support from the outset.  Pildes, The Supreme Court 2003 Term Foreword: The Constitutionalization of Democratic Politics, 118 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 28, 137 (2004).  Finally, it is important to remember just how incumbent-friendly congressional races were prior to BCRA\u2019s passage.  As the Solicitor General aptly remarked at the time, \u201cthe evidence supports overwhelmingly that incumbents were able to get re-elected under the old system just fine.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. in McConnell v. FEC, O. T. 2003, No. 02\u20131674, p. 61.  \u201cIt would be hard to develop a scheme that could be better for incumbents.\u201d  Id., at 63.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, then, \u201cthere is no convincing evidence that th[e] important interests favoring expenditure limits are fronts for incumbency protection.\u201d  Randall, 548 U. S., at 279 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  \u201cIn the meantime, a legislative judgment that \u2018enough is enough\u2019 should command the greatest possible deference from judges interpreting a constitutional provision that, at best, has an indirect relationship to activity that affects the quantity \u2026 of repetitive speech in the marketplace of ideas.\u201d  Id., at 279\u2013280.  The majority cavalierly ignores Congress\u2019 factual findings and its constitutional judgment: It acknowledges the validity of the interest in preventing corruption, but it effectively discounts the value of that interest to zero.  This is quite different from conscientious policing for impermissibly anticompetitive motive or effect in a sensitive First Amendment context.  It is the denial of Congress\u2019 authority to regulate corporate spending on\nelections.\nAustin and Corporate Expenditures\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the majority gives short shrift to the general societal interests at stake in campaign finance regulation, it also overlooks the distinctive considerations raised by the regulation of corporate expenditures.  The majority fails to appreciate that Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale is itself an anticorruption rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660 (describing \u201ca different type of corruption\u201d), tied to the special concerns raised by corporations.  Understood properly, \u201cantidistortion\u201d is simply a variant on the classic governmental interest in protecting against improper influences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic process.  It is manifestly not just an \u201c\u00a0\u2018equalizing\u2019\u00a0\u201d ideal in disguise.  Ante, at 34 (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48).[Footnote 69]\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Antidistortion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fact that corporations are different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the majority opinion almost completely elides it.  Austin set forth some of the basic differences.  Unlike natural persons, corporations have \u201climited liability\u201d for their owners and managers, \u201cperpetual life,\u201d separation of ownership and control, \u201cand favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets \u2026 that enhance their ability to attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that maximize the return on their shareholders\u2019 investments.\u201d  494 U. S., at 658\u2013659.  Unlike voters in U. S. elections, corporations may be foreign controlled.[Footnote 70]  Unlike other interest groups, business corporations have been \u201ceffectively delegated responsibility for ensuring society\u2019s economic welfare\u201d;[Footnote 71] they inescapably structure the life of every citizen.  \u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]he resources in the treasury of a business corporation,\u2019\u00a0\u201d furthermore, \u201c\u00a0\u2018are not an indication of popular support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 258).  \u201c\u00a0\u2018They reflect instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers.  The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  494 U. S., at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 258).[Footnote 72]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It might also be added that corporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires.  Corporations help structure and facilitate the activities of human beings, to be sure, and their \u201cpersonhood\u201d often serves as a useful legal fiction.  But they are not themselves members of \u201cWe the People\u201d by whom and for whom our Constitution was established.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These basic points help explain why corporate electioneering is not only more likely to impair compelling governmental interests, but also why restrictions on that electioneering are less likely to encroach upon First Amendment freedoms.  One fundamental concern of the First Amendment is to \u201cprotec[t] the individual\u2019s interest in self-expression.\u201d  Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\u00a0Y. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U. S. 530, 534, n.\u00a02 (1980); see also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777, n.\u00a012.  Freedom of speech helps \u201cmake men free to develop their faculties,\u201d Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), it respects their \u201cdignity and choice,\u201d Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 24 (1971), and it facilitates the value of \u201cindividual self-realization,\u201d Redish, The Value of Free Speech, 130 U.\u00a0Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 591, 594 (1982).  Corporate speech, however, is derivative speech, speech by proxy.  A regulation such as BCRA \u00a7203 may affect the way in which individuals disseminate certain messages through the corporate form, but it does not prevent anyone from speaking in his or her own voice.  \u201cWithin the realm of [campaign spending] generally,\u201d corporate spending is \u201cfurthest from the core of political expression.\u201d  Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 161, n.\u00a08.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is an interesting question \u201cwho\u201d is even speaking when a business corporation places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate.  Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in such matters.  It cannot realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political preferences may be opaque to management.  Perhaps the officers or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal ends.  Some individuals associated with the corporation must make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that these individuals are thereby fostering their self-expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful.  It is entirely possible that the corporation\u2019s electoral message will conflict with their personal convictions.  Take away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of those ads, and no one\u2019s autonomy, dignity, or political equality has been impinged upon in the least.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from individual expenditures in this respect.  I have taken the view that a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on individuals\u2019 electioneering expenditures in the service of the governmental interests explained above, and in recognition of the fact that such restrictions are not direct restraints on speech but rather on its financing.  See, e.g., Randall, 548 U. S., at 273 (dissenting opinion).  But those restrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the primary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is involved.  Some of those individuals might feel that they need to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particular candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral preferences.  This is obviously not the situation with business corporations, as their routine practice of giving \u201csubstantial sums to both major national parties\u201d makes pellucidly clear.  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 148.  \u201c[C]orporate participation\u201d in elections, any business executive will tell you, \u201cis more transactional than ideological.\u201d  Supp. Brief for Committee for Economic Development as Amicus Curiae 10.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this transactional spirit, some corporations have affirmatively urged Congress to place limits on their electioneering communications.  These corporations fear that officeholders will shake them down for supportive ads, that they will have to spend increasing sums on elections in an ever-escalating arms race with their competitors, and that public trust in business will be eroded.  See id., at 10\u201319.  A system that effectively forces corporations to use their shareholders\u2019 money both to maintain access to, and to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ultimately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corporations.  It can impose a kind of implicit tax.[Footnote 73]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, regulations such as \u00a7203 and the statute upheld in Austin impose only a limited burden on First Amendment freedoms not only because they target a narrow subset of expenditures and leave untouched the broader \u201cpublic dialogue,\u201d ante, at 25, but also because they leave untouched the speech of natural persons.  Recognizing the weakness of a speaker-based critique of Austin, the Court places primary emphasis not on the corporation\u2019s right to electioneer, but rather on the listener\u2019s interest in hearing what every possible speaker may have to say.  The Court\u2019s central argument is that laws such as \u00a7203 have \u201c\u00a0\u2018deprived [the electorate] of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 38 (quoting CIO, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J., concurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, \u201cinterferes with the \u2018open marketplace\u2019 of ideas protected by the First Amendment,\u201d ante, at 38 (quoting New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are many flaws in this argument.  If the overriding concern depends on the interests of the audience, surely the public\u2019s perception of the value of corporate speech should be given important weight.  That perception today is the same as it was a century ago when Theodore Roosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time, led to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign expenditures that is overruled today.  See WRTL, 551 U. S., at 509\u2013510 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President Roosevelt\u2019s remarks). The distinctive threat to democratic integrity posed by corporate domination of politics was recognized at \u201cthe inception of the republic\u201d and \u201chas been a persistent theme in American political life\u201d ever since.  Regan 302.  It is only certain Members of this Court, not the listeners themselves, who have agitated for more corporate electioneering.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin recognized that there are substantial reasons why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general treasury expenditures will give corporations \u201cunfai[r] influence\u201d in the electoral process, 494 U. S., at 660, and distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than advance the interests of listeners.  The legal structure of corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial resources on a scale few natural persons can match.  The structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a line between the corporation\u2019s economic interests and the political preferences of the individuals associated with the corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral process with the aim \u201cto enhance the profitability of the company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a broader or conflicting set of priorities,\u201d Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as Amicus Curiae 11; see also ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a72.01(a), p.\u00a055 (1992) (\u201c[A] corporation \u2026 should have as its objective the conduct of business activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit and shareholder gain\u201d).  In a state election such as the one at issue in Austin, the interests of nonresident corporations may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of local voters.  Consequently, when corporations grab up the prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can flood the market with advocacy that bears \u201clittle or no correlation\u201d to the ideas of natural persons or to any broader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660.  The opinions of real people may be marginalized.  \u201cThe expenditure restrictions of [2 U. S.\u00a0C.] \u00a7441b are thus meant to ensure that competition among actors in the political arena is truly competition among ideas.\u201d  MCFL, 479 U. S., at 259.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorporate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow soon thereafter.  Corporate \u201cdomination\u201d of electioneering, Austin, 494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that corporations dominate our democracy.  When citizens turn on their televisions and radios before an election and hear only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy.  A Government captured by corporate interests, they may come to believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor willing to give their views a fair hearing.  The predictable result is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased perception that large spenders \u201c\u00a0\u2018call the tune\u2019\u00a0\u201d and a reduced \u201c\u00a0\u2018willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390).  To the extent that corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in electoral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those races may also be chilled.  Politicians who fear that a certain corporation can make or break their reelection chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.  On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneering might diminish the ability of citizens to \u201chold officials accountable to the people,\u201d ante, at 23, and disserve the goal of a public debate that is \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964).  At the least, I stress again, a legislature is entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored measures in response.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s unwillingness to distinguish between corporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possibility that corporations\u2019 \u201cwar chests\u201d and their special \u201cadvantages\u201d in the legal realm, Austin, 494 U. S., at 659, may translate into special advantages in the market for legislation.  When large numbers of citizens have a common stake in a measure that is under consideration, it may be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on behalf of their position.  The corporate form, by contrast, \u201cprovides a simple way to channel rents to only those who have paid their dues, as it were.  If you do not own stock, you do not benefit from the larger dividends or appreciation in the stock price caused by the passage of private interest legislation.\u201d  Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech, Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate Charters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002).  Corporations, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that favor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of money but because of their legal and organizational structure.  Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and the door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is \u201cfar more destructive\u201d than what noncorporations are capable of.  Ibid.  It is for reasons such as these that our campaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that \u201cthe \u2018differing structures and purposes\u2019 of different entities \u2018may require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210 (quoting California Medical Assn., 453 U. S., at 201).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s facile depiction of corporate electioneering assumes away all of these complexities.  Our colleagues ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on \u201cnothing more\u201d than a fear that corporations have a special \u201cability to persuade,\u201d ante, at 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.), as if corporations were our society\u2019s ablest debaters and viewpoint-neutral laws such as \u00a7203 were created to suppress their best arguments.  In their haste to knock down yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore the fundamental concerns of the Austin Court and the legislatures that have passed laws like \u00a7203: to safeguard the integrity, competitiveness, and democratic responsiveness of the electoral process.  All of the majority\u2019s theoretical arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experience, \u201cthat there is no such thing as too much speech,\u201d Austin, 494 U. S., at 695 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).[Footnote 74]  If individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect virtue; then I suppose the majority\u2019s premise would be sound.  In the real world, we have seen, corporate domination of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener\u2019s exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens\u2019 willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of this is to suggest that corporations can or should be denied an opportunity to participate in election campaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a work of art such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be banned), or to deny that some corporate speech may contribute significantly to public debate.  What it shows, however, is that Austin\u2019s \u201cconcern about corporate domination of the political process,\u201d 494 U. S., at 659, reflects more than a concern to protect governmental interests outside of the First Amendment.  It also reflects a concern to facilitate First Amendment values by preserving some breathing room around the electoral \u201cmarketplace\u201d of ideas, ante, at 19, 34, 38, 52, 54, the marketplace in which the actual people of this Nation determine how they will govern themselves.  The majority seems oblivious to the simple truth that laws such as \u00a7203 do not merely pit the anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but also pit competing First Amendment values against each other.  There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any effort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers against the First Amendment rights of listeners.  But when the speakers in question are not real people and when the appeal to \u201cFirst Amendment principles\u201d depends almost entirely on the listeners\u2019 perspective, ante, at 1, 48, it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actually be affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In critiquing Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale and campaign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues place tremendous weight on the example of media corporations.  See ante, at 35\u201338, 46; ante, at 1, 11 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.); ante, at 6 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Yet it is not at all clear that Austin would permit \u00a7203 to be applied to them.  The press plays a unique role not only in the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment but also in facilitating public discourse; as the Austin Court explained, \u201cmedia corporations differ significantly from other corporations in that their resources are devoted to the collection of information and its dissemination to the public,\u201d 494 U. S., at 667.  Our colleagues have raised some interesting and difficult questions about Congress\u2019 authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and about how to define what constitutes the press.  But that is not the case before us.  Section 203 does not apply to media corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is not a media corporation.  There would be absolutely no reason to consider the issue of media corporations if the majority did not, first, transform Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge into a facial challenge and, second, invent the theory that legislatures must eschew all \u201cidentity\u201d-based distinctions and treat a local nonprofit news outlet exactly the same as General Motors.[Footnote 75]  This calls to mind George Berkeley\u2019s description of philosophers: \u201c[W]e have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see.\u201d  Principles of Human Knowledge/Three Dialogues 38, \u00b63 (R. Woolhouse ed. 1988).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would be perfectly understandable if our colleagues feared that a campaign finance regulation such as \u00a7203 may be counterproductive or self-interested, and therefore attended carefully to the choices the Legislature has made.  But the majority does not bother to consider such practical matters, or even to consult a record; it simply stipulates that \u201cenlightened self-government\u201d can arise only in the absence of regulation.  Ante, at 23.  In light of the distinctive features of corporations identified in Austin, there is no valid basis for this assumption.  The marketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items\u2014or laws\u2014are meant to be bought and sold, and when we move from the realm of economics to the realm of corporate electioneering, there may be no \u201creason to think the market ordering is intrinsically good at all,\u201d Strauss 1386.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the First Amendment may well promote corporate power at the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the Amendment was meant to serve.  It will undoubtedly cripple the ability of ordinary citizens, Congress, and the States to adopt even limited measures to protect against corporate domination of the electoral process.  Americans may be forgiven if they do not feel the Court has advanced the cause of self-government today.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shareholder Protection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is yet another way in which laws such as \u00a7203 can serve First Amendment values.  Interwoven with Austin\u2019s concern to protect the integrity of the electoral process is a concern to protect the rights of shareholders from a kind of coerced speech: electioneering expenditures that do not \u201creflec[t] [their] support.\u201d  494 U. S., at 660\u2013661.  When corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.  Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation\u2019s electoral message may find their financial investments being used to undermine their political convictions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that those who pay for an electioneering communication actually support its content and that managers do not use general treasuries to advance personal agendas.  Ibid.  It \u201c\u00a0\u2018allows corporate political participation without the temptation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204 (quoting Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163).  A rule that privileges the use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of dissenters.  Austin\u2019s acceptance of restrictions on general treasury spending \u201csimply allows people who have invested in the business corporation for purely economic reasons\u201d\u2014the vast majority of investors, one assumes\u2014\u201cto avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their economic objectives.\u201d  Winkler, Beyond Bellotti, 32 Loyola (LA) L.\u00a0Rev. 133, 201 (1998).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concern to protect dissenting shareholders and union members has a long history in campaign finance reform.  It provided a central motivation for the Tillman Act in 1907 and subsequent legislation, see Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 414\u2013415 (1972); Winkler, 92 Geo. L.\u00a0J., at 887\u2013900, and it has been endorsed in a long line of our cases, see, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 204\u2013205; Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 152\u2013154; MCFL, 479 U. S., at 258; NRWC, 459 U. S., at 207\u2013208; Pipefitters, 407 U. S., at 414\u2013416; see also n.\u00a060, supra.  Indeed, we have unanimously recognized the governmental interest in \u201cprotect[ing] the individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates from having that money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed.\u201d  NRWC, 459 U. S., at 207\u2013208.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court dismisses this interest on the ground that abuses of shareholder money can be corrected \u201cthrough the procedures of corporate democracy,\u201d ante, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted), and, it seems, through Internet-based disclosures, ante, at 55.[Footnote 76]  I fail to understand how this addresses the concerns of dissenting union members, who will also be affected by today\u2019s ruling, and I fail to understand why the Court is so confident in these mechanisms.  By \u201ccorporate democracy,\u201d presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty.  In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that \u201cthese rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,\u201d given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule.  Blair & Stout 320; see also id., at 298\u2013315; Winkler, 32 Loyola (LA) L.\u00a0Rev., at 165\u2013166, 199\u2013200.  Modern technology may help make it easier to track corporate activity, including electoral advocacy, but it is utopian to believe that it solves the problem.  Most American households that own stock do so through intermediaries such as mutual funds and pension plans, see Evans, A Requiem for the Retail Investor? 95 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 1105 (2009), which makes it more difficult both to monitor and to alter particular holdings.  Studies show that a majority of individual investors make no trades at all during a given year.  Id., at 1117.  Moreover, if the corporation in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees the company\u2019s ads may not know whether they are being funded through the PAC or through the general treasury.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has been spending general treasury money on objectionable electioneering, they can divest.  Even assuming that they reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only partial.  The injury to the shareholders\u2019 expressive rights has already occurred; they might have preferred to keep that corporation\u2019s stock in their portfolio for any number of economic reasons; and they may incur a capital gains tax or other penalty from selling their shares, changing their pension plan, or the like.  The shareholder protection rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable contributions in ways that any particular shareholder might disapprove.  But those expenditures do not implicate the selection of public officials, an area in which \u201cthe interests of unwilling \u2026 corporate shareholders [in not being] forced to subsidize that speech\u201d \u201care at their zenith.\u201d  Austin, 494 U. S., at 677 (Brennan, J., concurring).  And in any event, the question is whether shareholder protection provides a basis for regulating expenditures in the weeks before an election, not whether additional types of corporate communications might similarly be conditioned on voluntariness.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing the limits of the shareholder protection rationale, the Austin Court did not hold it out as an adequate and independent ground for sustaining the statute in question.  Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the antidistortion rationale, in two main ways.  First, the problem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if electioneering expenditures can advance the political views of some members of a corporation, they will often compromise the views of others.  See, e.g., id., at 663 (discussing risk that corporation\u2019s \u201cmembers may be \u2026 reluctant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with [its] political expression\u201d).  Second, it provides an additional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the corporate form, for doubting that these \u201cexpenditures reflect actual public support for the political ideas espoused,\u201d id., at 660.  The shareholder protection rationale, in other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on corporate electioneering can serve both speakers\u2019 and listeners\u2019 interests, as well as the anticorruption interest.  And it supplies yet another reason why corporate expenditures merit less protection than individual expenditures.\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today\u2019s decision is backwards in many senses.  It elevates the majority\u2019s agenda over the litigants\u2019 submissions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitutional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual dissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion over tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over reality.  Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that Austin must be overruled and that \u00a7203 is facially unconstitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and rationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the Court\u2019s lawmaking power.  Their conclusion that the societal interest in avoiding corruption and the appearance of corruption does not provide an adequate justification for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate elections relies on an incorrect description of that interest, along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of established facts and the considered judgments of state and federal legislatures over many decades.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on the need to limit corporate campaign spending should outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules.  The majority\u2019s rejection of this principle \u201celevate[s] corporations to a level of deference which has not been seen at least since the days when substantive due process was regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.\u201d  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 817, n. 13 (White, J., dissenting).  At bottom, the Court\u2019s opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self-government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt.  It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense.  While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. \n\u00a0Specifically, Part I, infra, at 4\u201317, addresses the procedural history of the case and the narrower grounds of decision the majority has bypassed.  Part II, infra, at 17\u201323, addresses stare decisis.  Part III, infra, at 23\u201356, addresses the Court\u2019s assumptions that BCRA \u201cbans\u201d corporate speech, that identity-based distinctions may not be drawn in the political realm, and that Austin and McConnell were outliers in our First Amendment tradition.  Part IV, infra, at 56\u201389, addresses the Court\u2019s treatment of the anticorruption, antidistortion, and shareholder protection rationales for regulating corporate electioneering.\n\u00a0See Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (\u201c[U]nder this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a), only questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); Wood v. Allen, ante, at __ (slip op., at 13) (\u201c[T]he fact that petitioner discussed [an] issue in the text of his petition for certiorari does not bring it before us.  Rule 14.1(a) requires that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the question presented for our review\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 168\u2013169 (2004) (\u201cWe ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0The majority states that, in denying Citizens United\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, the District Court \u201caddressed\u201d the facial validity of BCRA \u00a7203.  Ante, at 13.  That is true, in the narrow sense that the court observed the issue was foreclosed by McConnell v. FEC, 540 U. S. 93 (2003).  See 530 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 274, 278 (DC 2008) (per curiam).  Yet as explained above, Citizens United subsequently dismissed its facial challenge, so that by the time the District Court granted the Federal Election Commission\u2019s (FEC) motion for summary judgment, App. 261a\u2013262a, any question about statutory validity had dropped out of the case.  That latter ruling by the District Court was the \u201cfinal decision\u201d from which Citizens United appealed to this Court under BCRA \u00a7403(a)(3).  As regards the lower court decision that has come before us, the claim that \u00a7203 is facially unconstitutional was neither pressed nor passed upon in any form.\n\u00a0Shortly before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its facial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it \u201crequire[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial challenge.\u201d  1:07\u2013cv\u20132240\u2013RCL\u2013RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar. 26, 2008).  By reinstating a claim that Citizens United abandoned, the Court gives it a perverse litigating advantage over its adversary, which was deprived of the opportunity to gather and present information necessary to its rebuttal.\n\u00a0In fact, we do not even have a good evidentiary record of how \u00a7203 has been affecting Citizens United, which never submitted to the District Court the details of Hillary\u2019s funding or its own finances.  We likewise have no evidence of how \u00a7203 and comparable state laws were expected to affect corporations and unions in the future.\n\n\nIt is true, as the majority points out, that the McConnell Court evaluated the facial validity of \u00a7203 in light of an extensive record.  See ante, at 15.  But that record is not before us in this case.  And in any event, the majority\u2019s argument for striking down \u00a7203 depends on its contention that the statute has proved too \u201cchilling\u201d in practice\u2014and in particular on the contention that the controlling opinion in WRTL, 551 U. S. 449 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and \u201cbreathing space\u201d to this area of law.  See ante, at 12, 16\u201320.  We have no record with which to assess that claim.  The Court complains at length about the burdens of complying with \u00a7203, but we have no meaningful evidence to show how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its restrictions.\n\u00a0Our cases recognize a \u201ctype of facial challenge in the First Amendment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad because a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional.\u201d  Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n.\u00a06 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Citizens United has not made an overbreadth argument, and \u201c[w]e generally do not apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analysis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  If our colleagues nonetheless concluded that \u00a7203\u2019s fatal flaw is that it affects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for overbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissible, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.\n\u00a0Also perplexing is the majority\u2019s attempt to pass blame to the Government for its litigating position.  By \u201chold[ing] out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from adopting that position,\u201d the majority says, the Government has caused \u201cadded uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.\u201d  Ante, at 17.  Our colleagues have apparently never heard of an alternative argument.  Like every litigant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that, it would prefer to lose on a narrow ground.  The fact that there are numerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the Government acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything about the propriety of a facial ruling.\n\u00a0The majority\u2019s \u201cchilling\u201d argument is particularly inapposite with respect to 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b\u2019s longstanding restriction on the use of corporate general treasury funds for express advocacy.  If there was ever any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional equivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what counts as express advocacy since the \u201cmagic words\u201d test of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 44, n.\u00a052 (1976) (per curiam).  Yet even though Citizens United\u2019s briefs never once mention \u00a7441b\u2019s restriction on express advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate chilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that Hillary counts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to opine that this statutory provision is \u201cinvalid\u201d as well.  Ante, at 50.\n\u00a0The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges does not have \u201csome automatic effect\u201d that mechanically controls the judicial task.  Ante, at 14.  I agree, but it does not follow that in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less invert it.\n\u00a0Professor Fallon proposes an intricate answer to this question that the majority ignores.  Fallon 1327\u20131359.  It bears mention that our colleagues have previously cited Professor Fallon\u2019s article for the exact opposite point from the one they wish to make today.  In Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007), the Court explained that \u201c[i]t is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop,\u201d and \u201c[f]or this reason, \u2018[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 168 (opinion for the Court by Kennedy, J.) (quoting Fallon 1328 (second alteration in original)).\n\u00a0Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(4) applies, inter alia, to nonprofit organizations \u201coperated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, \u2026 the net earnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes.\u201d\n\u00a0The Chief Justice is therefore much too quick when he suggests that, \u201c[e]ven if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens United\u2014because corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights\u2014would mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win.\u201d  Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion).  That conclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens United\u2019s plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implausible position that all corporations and all types of expenditures enjoy the same First Amendment protections, which always trump the interests in regulation.  At times, the majority appears to endorse this extreme view.  At other times, however, it appears to suggest that nonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protection than for-profit corporations, see ante, at 20, 39, \u201cadvocacy\u201d organizations have a better claim than other nonprofits, ante, at 20, domestic corporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, ante, at 46\u201347, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations, ante, at 38\u201340, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast communications, ante, at 33.  The majority never uses a multinational business corporation in its hypotheticals.\n\u00a0The Court entirely ignores this statutory argument.  It concludes that \u00a7203 applies to Hillary on the basis of the film\u2019s content, ante, at 7\u20138, without considering the possibility that \u00a7203 does not apply to video-on-demand transmissions generally.\n\u00a0See Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F.\u00a03d 1137, 1148 (CA10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that \u201cevery other circuit to have addressed this issue\u201d has done likewise); Brief for Independent Sector as Amicus Curiae 10\u201311 (collecting cases).  The Court rejects this solution in part because the Government \u201cmerely suggest[s] it\u201d and \u201cdoes not say that it agrees with the interpretation.\u201d  Ante, at 11.  Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing insufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same time that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly abandoned.  The Court also protests that a de minimis standard would \u201crequir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.\u201d  Ante, at 12.  But de minimis tests need not be intricate at all.  A test that granted MCFL status to \u00a7501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed dollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such donations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets, would be perfectly easy to understand and administer.\n\u00a0Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have been to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA \u00a7203(c), allowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering communications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace the payments to individual contributions.  See Brief for National Rifle Association as Amicus Curiae 5\u201315 (arguing forcefully that Congress intended this result).\n\u00a0The Chief Justice finds our discussion of these narrower solutions \u201cquite perplexing\u201d because we suggest that the Court should \u201clatch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question,\u201d without doing the same ourselves.  Ante, at 3.  There is nothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly situated to our colleagues in the majority.  We do not share their view of the First Amendment.  Our reading of the Constitution would not lead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this case, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional avoidance or to vindicate Citizens United\u2019s as-applied challenge.  Each of the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statutory argument the Court accepted in last year\u2019s Voting Rights Act case, Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. __ (2009).\n\u00a0I will have more to say shortly about the merits\u2014about why Austin and McConnell are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and why their logic is not only defensible but also compelling.  For present purposes, I limit the discussion to stare-decisis-specific considerations.\n\u00a0The Chief Justice suggests that Austin has been undermined by subsequent dissenting opinions.  Ante, at 9.  Under this view, it appears that the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of requests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes.  The Chief Justice further suggests that Austin \u201cis uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court\u2019s decisions even outside\u201d its particular facts, as when we applied its reasoning in McConnell.  Ante, at 9.  Once again, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the more we call it into question.  For those who believe Austin was correctly decided\u2014as the Federal Government and the States have long believed, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since Austin have believed, and as we continue to believe\u2014there is nothing \u201cdestabilizing\u201d about the prospect of its continued application.  It is gutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does today, that will be destabilizing.\n\u00a0Additionally, the majority cites some recent scholarship challenging the historical account of campaign finance law given in United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567 (1957).  Ante, at 48.  Austin did not so much as allude to this historical account, much less rely on it.  Even if the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign finance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than Automobile Workers suggested, the point remains that this body of law has played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political life for decades upon decades.\n\u00a0See Brief for State of Montana et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5\u201313; see also Supp. Brief for Senator John McCain et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 1a\u20138a (listing 24 States that presently limit or prohibit independent electioneering expenditures from corporate general treasuries).\n\u00a0Magleby, The Importance of the Record in McConnell v. FEC, 3 Election L.\u00a0J. 285 (2004).\n\u00a0To be sure, the majority may respond that Congress can correct the imbalance by removing BCRA\u2019s soft-money limits.  Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24 (Sept. 9, 2009) (query of Kennedy, J.).  But this is no response to any legislature that takes campaign finance regulation seriously.  It merely illustrates the breadth of the majority\u2019s deregulatory vision.\n\u00a0See Brief for Committee for Economic Development as Amicus Curiae; Brief for American Independent Business Alliance as Amicus Curiae.  But see Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as Amicus Curiae.\n\u00a0See Brief for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae 3, 9.\n\u00a0See Brief for Independent Sector as Amicus Curiae 16\u201320.\n\u00a0See Brief for State of Montana et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae.\n\u00a0The FEC established this process following the Court\u2019s June 2007 decision in that case, 551 U. S. 449.  In the brief interval between the establishment of this process and the 2008 election, corporations and unions used it to make $108.5 million in electioneering communications.  Supp. Brief for Appellee 22\u201323; FEC, Electioneering Communication Summary, online at http://fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ECSummary.shtml (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 18, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n\u00a0Concedely, Austin and McConnell were constitutional decisions, and we have often said that \u201cclaims of stare decisis are at the weakest in that field, where our mistakes cannot be corrected by Congress.\u201d  Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 305 (2004) (plurality opinion).  As a general matter, this principle is a sound one.  But the principle only takes on real force when an earlier ruling has obstructed the normal democratic process; it is the fear of making \u201cmistakes [that] cannot be corrected by Congress,\u201d ibid., that motivates us to review constitutional precedents with a more critical eye.  Austin and McConnell did not obstruct state or congressional legislative power in any way.  Although it is unclear how high a bar today\u2019s decision will pose to future attempts to regulate corporate electioneering, it will clearly restrain much legislative action.\n\u00a0See FEC, Number of Federal PAC\u2019s Increases, http://fec.gov/press/\npress2008/20080812paccount.shtml.\n\u00a0See Supp. Brief for Appellee 16 (citing FEC statistics placing this figure at $840 million).  The majority finds the PAC option inadequate in part because \u201c[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation.\u201d  Ante, at 21.  The formal \u201cseparateness\u201d of PACs from their host corporations\u2014which administer and control the PACs but which cannot funnel general treasury funds into them or force members to support them\u2014is, of course, the whole point of the PAC mechanism.\n\u00a0Roaming far afield from the case at hand, the majority worries that the Government will use \u00a7203 to ban books, pamphlets, and blogs.  Ante, at 20, 33, 49.  Yet by its plain terms, \u00a7203 does not apply to printed material.  See 2 U. S. C. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A)(i); see also 11 CFR \u00a7100.29(c)(1) (\u201c[E]lectioneering communication does not include communications appearing in print media\u201d).  And in light of the ordinary understanding of the terms \u201cbroadcast, cable, [and] satellite,\u201d \u00a7434(f)(3)(A)(i), coupled with Congress\u2019 clear aim of targeting \u201ca virtual torrent of televised election-related ads,\u201d McConnell, 540 U. S., at 207, we highly doubt that \u00a7203 could be interpreted to apply to a Web site or book that happens to be transmitted at some stage over airwaves or cable lines, or that the FEC would ever try to do so.  See 11 CFR \u00a7100.26 (exempting most Internet communications from regulation as advertising); \u00a7100.155 (exempting uncompensated Internet activity from regulation as an expenditure); Supp. Brief for Center for Independent Media et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 14 (explaining that \u201cthe FEC has consistently construed [BCRA\u2019s] media exemption to apply to a variety of non-traditional media\u201d).  If it should, the Government acknowledges \u201cthere would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).\n\u00a0As the Government points out, with a media corporation there is also a lesser risk that investors will not understand, learn about, or support the advocacy messages that the corporation disseminates.

Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57 (1965)).  The FEC\u2019s business is to administer and enforce the campaign finance laws.  The regulatory body at issue in Freedman was a state Board of Censors that had virtually unfettered discretion to bar distribution of motion picture films it deemed not to be \u201cmoral and proper.\u201d  See id., at 52\u201353, and n.\u00a02.  No movie could be shown in the State of Maryland that was not first approved and licensed by the Board of Censors.  Id., at 52, n.\u00a01.  It is an understatement to say that Freedman is not on point, and the majority\u2019s characterization of the FEC is deeply disconcerting.\n\u00a0Citizens United has administered this PAC for over a decade.  See Defendant FEC\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Second Motion for Preliminary Injunction in No. 07\u20132240 (ARR, RCL, RWR) (DC), p. 20.

S. 119, 129 (1977) (\u201cIn a prison context, an inmate does not retain those First Amendment rights that are inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0See, e.g., Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 758 (1974) (\u201cWhile the members of the military are not excluded from the protection granted by the First Amendment, the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections\u201d).\n\u00a0See, e.g., 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441e(a)(1) (foreign nationals may not directly or indirectly make contributions or independent expenditures in connection with a U. S. election).\n\u00a0See, e.g., Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548 (1973) (upholding statute prohibiting Executive Branch employees from taking \u201cany active part in political management or in political campaigns\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75 (1947) (same); United States v. Wurzbach, 280 U. S. 396 (1930) (upholding statute prohibiting federal employees from making contributions to Members of Congress for \u201cany political purpose whatever\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Ex parte Curtis, 106 U. S. 371 (1882) (upholding statute prohibiting certain federal employees from giving money to other employees for political purposes). \n\u00a0The majority states that the cases just cited are \u201cinapposite\u201d because they \u201cstand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech.\u201d  Ante, at 25.  The majority\u2019s creative suggestion that these cases stand only for that one proposition is quite implausible.  In any event, the proposition lies at the heart of this case, as Congress and half the state legislatures have concluded, over many decades, that their core functions of administering elections and passing legislation cannot operate effectively without some narrow restrictions on corporate electioneering paid for by general treasury funds.\n\u00a0Outside of the law, of course, it is a commonplace that the identity and incentives of the speaker might be relevant to an assessment of his speech.  See Aristotle, Poetics 43\u201344 (M. Heath transl. 1996) (\u201cIn evaluating any utterance or action, one must take into account not just the moral qualities of what is actually done or said, but also the identity of the agent or speaker, the addressee, the occasion, the means, and the motive\u201d).  The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper subject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer and disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.\n\u00a0I dissented in Forbes because the broadcaster\u2019s decision to exclude the respondent from its debate was done \u201con the basis of entirely subjective, ad\u00a0hoc judgments,\u201d 523 U. S., at 690, that suggested anticompetitive viewpoint discrimination, id., at 693\u2013694, and lacked a compelling justification.  Needless to say, my concerns do not apply to the instant case.\n\u00a0The law at issue in Burson was far from unusual.  \u201c[A]ll 50 States,\u201d the Court observed, \u201climit access to the areas in or around polling places.\u201d  504 U. S., at 206; see also Note, 91 Ky. L.\u00a0J. 715, 729, n.\u00a089, 747\u2013769 (2003) (collecting statutes).  I dissented in Burson because the evidence adduced to justify Tennessee\u2019s law was \u201cexceptionally thin,\u201d 504 U. S., at 219, and \u201cthe reason for [the] restriction [had] disappear[ed]\u201d over time, id., at 223.  \u201cIn short,\u201d I concluded, \u201cTennessee ha[d] failed to point to any legitimate interest that would justify its selective regulation of campaign-related expression.\u201d  Id., at 225.  These criticisms are inapplicable to the case before us.\n\u00a0They are likewise entitled to regulate media corporations differently from other corporations \u201cto ensure that the law \u2018does not hinder or prevent the institutional press from reporting on, and publishing editorials about, newsworthy events.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 208 (quoting Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 668 (1990)).\n\u00a0The Court all but confesses that a categorical approach to speaker identity is untenable when it acknowledges that Congress might be allowed to take measures aimed at \u201cpreventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation\u2019s political process.\u201d  Ante, at 46\u201347.  Such measures have been a part of U. S. campaign finance law for many years.  The notion that Congress might lack the authority to distinguish foreigners from citizens in the regulation of electioneering would certainly have surprised the Framers, whose \u201cobsession with foreign influence derived from a fear that foreign powers and individuals had no basic investment in the well-being of the country.\u201d  Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 341, 393, n.\u00a0245 (2009) (hereinafter Teachout); see also U. S. Const.,  Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 8 (\u201c[N]o Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust \u2026 shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State\u201d).  Professor Teachout observes that a corporation might be analogized to a foreign power in this respect, \u201cinasmuch as its legal loyalties necessarily exclude patriotism.\u201d  Teachout 393, n.\u00a0245.\n\u00a0See A. Bickel, The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress 59\u201360 (1978); A. Meiklejohn, Political Freedom: The Constitutional Powers of the People 39\u201340 (1965); Tokaji, First Amendment Equal Protection: On Discretion, Inequality, and Participation, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 2409, 2508\u20132509 (2003).  Of course, voting is not speech in a pure or formal sense, but then again neither is a campaign expenditure; both are nevertheless communicative acts aimed at influencing electoral outcomes.  Cf. Strauss, Corruption, Equality, and Campaign Finance Reform, 94 Colum. L.\u00a0Rev. 1369, 1383\u20131384 (1994) (hereinafter Strauss).\n\u00a0Scholars have found that only a handful of business corporations were issued charters during the colonial period, and only a few hundred during all of the 18th century.  See E. Dodd, American Business Corporations Until 1860, p.\u00a0197 (1954); L. Friedman, A History of American Law 188\u2013189 (2d ed. 1985); Baldwin, American Business Corporations Before 1789, 8 Am. Hist. Rev. 449, 450\u2013459 (1903).  Justice Scalia quibbles with these figures; whereas we say that \u201ca few hundred\u201d charters were issued to business corporations during the 18th century, he says that the number is \u201capproximately 335.\u201d  Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion).  Justice Scalia also raises the more serious point that it is improper to assess these figures by today\u2019s standards, ante, at 3, though I believe he fails to substantiate his claim that \u201cthe corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life\u201d by the century\u2019s end, ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  His formulation of that claim is also misleading, because the relevant reference point is not 1800 but the date of the First Amendment\u2019s ratification, in 1791.  And at that time, the number of business charters must have been significantly smaller than 335, because the pace of chartering only began to pick up steam in the last decade of the 18th century.  More than half of the century\u2019s total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800.  Friedman, History of American Law, at 189.\n\u00a0See Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Tom Logan (Nov. 12, 1816), in 12 The Works of Thomas Jefferson 42, 44 (P. Ford ed. 1905) (\u201cI hope we shall \u2026 crush in [its] birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country\u201d).\n\u00a0In normal usage then, as now, the term \u201cspeech\u201d referred to oral communications by individuals.  See, e.g., 2 S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language 1853\u20131854 (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978) (listing as primary definition of \u201cspeech\u201d: \u201cThe power of articulate utterance; the power of expressing thoughts by vocal words\u201d); 2 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970) (listing as primary definition of \u201cspeech\u201d: \u201cThe faculty of uttering articulate sounds or words, as in human beings; the faculty of expressing thoughts by words or articulate sounds.  Speech was given to man by his Creator for the noblest purposes\u201d).  Indeed, it has been \u201cclaimed that the notion of institutional speech \u2026 did not exist in post-revolutionary America.\u201d  Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006); see also Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L.\u00a0Rev. 735, 775 (1995) (\u201cIn the intellectual heritage of the eighteenth century, the idea that free speech was individual and personal was deeply rooted and clearly manifest in the writings of Locke, Milton, and others on whom the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights drew\u201d).  Given that corporations were conceived of as artificial entities and do not have the technical capacity to \u201cspeak,\u201d the burden of establishing that the Framers and ratifiers understood \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d to encompass corporate speech is, I believe, far heavier than the majority acknowledges.\n\u00a0Postratification practice bolsters the conclusion that the First Amendment, \u201cas originally understood,\u201d ante, at 37, did not give corporations political speech rights on a par with the rights of individuals.  Well into the modern era of general incorporation statutes, \u201c[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978) (White, J., dissenting), and this Court did not recognize any First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century, see ante, at 25\u201326 (listing cases).\n\u00a0In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against Justice Scalia, for two reasons.  First, we learn from it that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctions\u2014explicit distinctions\u2014between types of \u201cspeakers,\u201d or speech outlets or forms.  Second, the Court\u2019s strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers\u2019 views on the press, see ante, at 37\u201338; ante, at 4\u20136 (Scalia, J., concurring), yet while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home.  The text and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of \u201cidentity\u201d-based distinctions might be permissible after all.  Once one accepts that much, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.\n\u00a0Cf. L. Levy, Legacy of Suppression: Freedom of Speech and Press in Early American History 4 (1960) (\u201cThe meaning of no other clause of the Bill of Rights at the time of its framing and ratification has been so obscure to us\u201d as the Free Speech and Press Clause).\n\u00a0As the majority notes, there is some academic debate about the precise origins of these developments.  Ante, at 48; see also n.\u00a019, supra.  There is always some academic debate about such developments; the motives of legislatures are never entirely clear or unitary.  Yet the basic shape and trajectory of 20th-century campaign finance reform are clear, and one need not take a nave or triumphalist view of this history to find it highly relevant.  The Court\u2019s skepticism does nothing to mitigate the absurdity of its claim that Austin and McConnell were outliers.  Nor does it alter the fact that five Justices today destroy a longstanding American practice.\n\u00a0See Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 409, 414\u2013415 (1972) (reading the statutory bar on corporate and union campaign spending not to apply to \u201cthe voluntary donations of employees,\u201d when maintained in a separate account, because \u201c[t]he dominant [legislative] concern in requiring that contributions be voluntary was, after all, to protect the dissenting stockholder or union member\u201d); Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 592 (advising the District Court to consider on remand whether the broadcast in question was \u201cpaid for out of the general dues of the union membership or [whether] the funds [could] be fairly said to have obtained on a voluntary basis\u201d); United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106, 123 (1948) (observing that \u201cfunds voluntarily contributed [by union members or corporate stockholders] for election purposes\u201d might not be covered by the expenditure bar).  Both the Pipefitters and the Automobile Workers Court approvingly referenced Congress\u2019 goal of reducing \u201cthe effect of aggregated wealth on federal elections,\u201d understood as wealth drawn from a corporate or union general treasury without the stockholders\u2019 or members\u2019 \u201cfree and knowing choice.\u201d  Pipefitters, 407 U. S., at 416; see Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 582.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two dissenters in Pipefitters would not have read the statutory provision in question, a successor to \u00a7304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, to allow such robust use of corporate and union funds to finance otherwise prohibited electioneering.  \u201cThis opening of the door to extensive corporate and union influence on the elective and legislative processes,\u201d Justice Powell wrote, \u201cmust be viewed with genuine concern.  This seems to me to be a regressive step as contrasted with the numerous legislative and judicial actions in recent years designed to assure that elections are indeed free and representative.\u201d  407 U. S., at 450 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.\u00a0J.).\n\u00a0Specifically, these corporations had to meet three conditions.  First, they had to be formed \u201cfor the express purpose of promoting political ideas,\u201d so that their resources reflected political support rather than commercial success.  MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  Next, they had to have no shareholders, so that \u201cpersons connected with the organization will have no economic disincentive for disassociating with it if they disagree with its political activity.\u201d  Ibid.  Finally, they could not be \u201cestablished by a business corporation or a labor union,\u201d nor \u201caccept contributions from such entities,\u201d lest they \u201cserv[e] as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.\u201d  Ibid.\n\u00a0According to The Chief Justice, we are \u201cerroneou[s]\u201d in claiming that McConnell and Beaumont \u201c\u00a0\u2018reaffirmed\u2019\u00a0\u201d Austin.  Ante, at 5.  In both cases, the Court explicitly relied on Austin and quoted from it at length.  See 540 U. S., at 204\u2013205; 539 U. S., at 153\u2013155, 158, 160, 163; see also ante, at 15 (\u201cThe holding and validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of the McConnell majority opinion\u201d); Brief for Appellants National Rifle Association et\u00a0al., O.\u00a0T. 2003, No. 02\u20131675, p. 21 (\u201cBeaumont reaffirmed \u2026 the Austin rationale for restricting expenditures\u201d).  The McConnell Court did so in the teeth of vigorous protests by Justices in today\u2019s majority that Austin should be overruled.  See ante, at 15 (citing relevant passages); see also Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163\u2013164 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  Both Courts also heard criticisms of Austin from parties or amici.  See Brief for Appellants Chamber of Commerce of the United States et\u00a0al., O.\u00a0T. 2003, No. 02\u20131756, p.\u00a035, n.\u00a022; Reply Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch McConnell et\u00a0al., O.\u00a0T. 2003, No. 02\u20131674, pp.\u00a013\u201314; Brief for Pacific Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae in FEC v. Beaumont, O.\u00a0T. 2002, No. 02\u2013403, passim.  If this does not qualify as reaffirmation of a precedent, then I do not know what would.\n\u00a0Cf. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 389 (2000) (recognizing \u201cthe broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors\u201d).  Though discrete in scope, these experiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a chance at functioning effectively and preserving the public\u2019s trust.  \u201cEven if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influence is manifest.  And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 153.  There should be nothing controversial about the proposition that the influence being targeted is \u201cundue.\u201d  In a democracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim of placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the benefactor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its arguments are seen as especially persuasive.\n\u00a0The majority declares by fiat that the appearance of undue influence by high-spending corporations \u201cwill not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\u201d  Ante, at 44.  The electorate itself has consistently indicated otherwise, both in opinion polls, see McConnell v. FEC, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 176, 557\u2013558, 623\u2013624 (DC 2003) (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.), and in the laws its representatives have passed, and our colleagues have no basis for elevating their own optimism into a tenet of constitutional law.\n\u00a0Quite distinct from the interest in preventing improper influences on the electoral process, I have long believed that \u201ca number of [other] purposes, both legitimate and substantial, may justify the imposition of reasonable limitations on the expenditures permitted during the course of any single campaign.\u201d  Davis v. FEC, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 3) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In my judgment, such limitations may be justified to the extent they are tailored to \u201cimproving the quality of the exposition of ideas\u201d that voters receive, ibid., \u201cfree[ing] candidates and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising,\u201d ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201cprotect[ing] equal access to the political arena,\u201d Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 278 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  I continue to adhere to these beliefs, but they have not been briefed by the parties or amici in this case, and their soundness is immaterial to its proper disposition.\n\u00a0In fact, the notion that the \u201celectioneering communications\u201d covered by \u00a7203 can breed quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of such corruption has only become more plausible since we decided McConnell.  Recall that The Chief Justice\u2019s controlling opinion in WRTL subsequently limited BCRA\u2019s definition of \u201celectioneering communications\u201d to those that are \u201csusceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\u201d  551 U. S., at 470.  The upshot was that after WRTL, a corporate or union expenditure could be regulated under \u00a7203 only if everyone would understand it as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office.  It does not take much imagination to perceive why this type of advocacy might be especially apt to look like or amount to a deal or a threat.\n\u00a0\u201cWe must give weight\u201d and \u201cdue deference\u201d to Congress\u2019 efforts to dispel corruption, the Court states at one point.  Ante, at 45.  It is unclear to me what these maxims mean, but as applied by the Court they clearly do not entail \u201cdeference\u201d in any normal sense of that term.\n\u00a0Justice Breyer has suggested that we strike the balance as follows: \u201cWe should defer to [the legislature\u2019s] political judgment that unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process.  But we should not defer in respect to whether its solution \u2026 insulates legislators from effective electoral challenge.\u201d  Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 403\u2013404 (concurring opinion).\n\u00a0The Chief Justice denies this, ante, at 9\u201310, citing scholarship that has interpreted Austin to endorse an equality rationale, along with an article by Justice Thurgood Marshall\u2019s former law clerk that states that Marshall, the author of Austin, accepted \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d and \u201cequalizing access to the political process\u201d as bases for campaign finance regulation, Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall\u2019s Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L.\u00a0J. 655, 667\u2013668 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is fair to say that Austin can bear an egalitarian reading, and I have no reason to doubt this characterization of Justice Marshall\u2019s beliefs.  But the fact that Austin can be read a certain way hardly proves The Chief Justice\u2019s charge that there is nothing more to it.  Many of our precedents can bear multiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some \u201cequalizing\u201d implications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our takings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure.  More important, the Austin Court expressly declined to rely on a speech-equalization rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660, and we have never understood Austin to stand for such a rationale.  Whatever his personal views, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that The Chief Justice suggests he did; indeed, he \u201cwould have viewed it as irresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale based on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would have even considered joining,\u201d Garrett, 52 Howard L.\u00a0J., at 674.\n\u00a0In state elections, even domestic corporations may be \u201cforeign\u201d-controlled in the sense that they are incorporated in another jurisdiction and primarily owned and operated by out-of-state residents.\n\u00a0Regan, Corporate Speech and Civic Virtue, in Debating Democracy\u2019s Discontent 289, 302 (A. Allen & M. Regan eds. 1998) (hereinafter Regan).\n\u00a0Nothing in this analysis turns on whether the corporation is conceptualized as a grantee of a state concession, see, e.g., Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 636 (1819) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.), a nexus of explicit and implicit contracts, see, e.g., F. Easterbrook & D. Fischel, The Economic Structure of Corporate Law 12 (1991), a mediated hierarchy of stakeholders, see, e.g., Blair & Stout, A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law, 85 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 247 (1999) (hereinafter Blair & Stout), or any other recognized model.  Austin referred to the structure and the advantages of corporations as \u201cstate-conferred\u201d in several places, 494 U. S., at 660, 665, 667, but its antidistortion argument relied only on the basic descriptive features of corporations, as sketched above.  It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the corporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in fundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to regulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its concern.  Cf. Hansmann & Kraakman 441, n.\u00a05.\n\u00a0Not all corporations support BCRA \u00a7203, of course, and not all corporations are large business entities or their tax-exempt adjuncts.  Some nonprofit corporations are created for an ideological purpose.  Some closely held corporations are strongly identified with a particular owner or founder.  The fact that \u00a7203, like the statute at issue in Austin, regulates some of these corporations\u2019 expenditures does not disturb the analysis above.  See 494 U. S., at 661\u2013665.  Small-business owners may speak in their own names, rather than the business\u2019, if they wish to evade \u00a7203 altogether.  Nonprofit corporations that want to make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they refuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to disassociate without economic penalty.  See MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, 264 (1986).  Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a concern about BCRA\u2019s coverage of nonprofits that have ideological missions but lack MCFL status, our colleagues refuse to apply the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment or the lower courts\u2019 de minimis exception to MCFL.  See ante, at 10\u201312.\n\u00a0Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, classroom, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.\n\u00a0Under the majority\u2019s view, the legislature is thus damned if it does and damned if it doesn\u2019t.  If the legislature gives media corporations an exemption from electioneering regulations that apply to other corporations, it violates the newly minted First Amendment rule against identity-based distinctions.  If the legislature does not give media corporations an exemption, it violates the First Amendment rights of the press.

This section of the dissent purports to show that today\u2019s decision is not supported by the original understanding of the First Amendment.  The dissent attempts this demonstration, however, in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment.  It never shows why \u201cthe freedom of speech\u201d that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form.  To be sure, in 1791 (as now) corporations could pursue only the objectives set forth in their charters; but the dissent provides no evidence that their speech in the pursuit of those objectives could be censored.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of taking this straightforward approach to determining the Amendment\u2019s meaning, the dissent embarks on a detailed exploration of the Framers\u2019 views about the \u201crole of corporations in society.\u201d  Post, at 35.  The Framers didn\u2019t like corporations, the dissent concludes, and therefore it follows (as night the day) that corporations had no rights of free speech.  Of course the Framers\u2019 personal affection or disaffection for corporations is relevant only insofar as it can be thought to be reflected in the understood meaning of the text they enacted\u2014not, as the dissent suggests, as a freestanding substitute for that text.  But the dissent\u2019s distortion of proper analysis is even worse than that.  Though faced with a constitutional text that makes no distinction between types of speakers, the dissent feels no necessity to provide even an isolated statement from the founding era to the effect that corporations are not covered, but places the burden on petitioners to bring forward statements showing that they are (\u201cthere is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed [the First Amendment] would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form,\u201d post, at 34\u201335).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the corporation-hating quotations the dissent has dredged up, it is far from clear that by the end of the 18th century corporations were despised.  If so, how came there to be so many of them?  The dissent\u2019s statement that there were few business corporations during the eighteenth century\u2014\u201conly a few hundred during all of the 18th century\u201d\u2014is misleading.  Post, at 35, n.\u200253.  There were approximately 335 charters issued to business corporations in the United States by the end of the 18th century.[Footnote 2]  See 2 J.\u2002Davis, Essays in the Earlier History of American Corporations 24 (1917) (reprint 2006) (hereinafter Davis).  This was a \u201cconsiderable extension of corporate enterprise in the field of business,\u201d Davis 8, and represented \u201cunprecedented growth,\u201d id., at 309.  Moreover, what seems like a small number by today\u2019s standards surely does not indicate the relative importance of corporations when the Nation was considerably smaller.  As I have previously noted, \u201c[b]y the end of the eighteenth century the corporation was a familiar figure in American economic life.\u201d  McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 256 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (quoting C. Cooke, Corporation Trust and Company 92 (1951) (hereinafter Cooke)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if we thought it proper to apply the dissent\u2019s approach of excluding from First Amendment coverage what the Founders disliked, and even if we agreed that the Founders disliked founding-era corporations; modern corporations might not qualify for exclusion.  Most of the Founders\u2019 resentment towards corporations was directed at the state-granted monopoly privileges that individually chartered corporations enjoyed.[Footnote 3]  Modern corporations do not have such privileges, and would probably have been favored by most of our enterprising Founders\u2014excluding, perhaps, Thomas Jefferson and others favoring perpetuation of an agrarian society.  Moreover, if the Founders\u2019 specific intent with respect to corporations is what matters, why does the dissent ignore the Founders\u2019 views about other legal entities that have more in common with modern business corporations than the founding-era corporations?  At the time of the founding, religious, educational, and literary corporations were incorporated under general incorporation statutes, much as business corporations are today.[Footnote 4]  See Davis 16\u201317; R. Seavoy, Origins of the American Business Corporation, 1784\u20131855, p.\u00a05 (1982); Cooke 94.  There were also small unincorporated business associations, which some have argued were the \u201c\u00a0\u2018true progenitors\u2019\u00a0\u201d of today\u2019s business corporations.  Friedman 200 (quoting S. Livermore, Early American Land Companies: Their Influence on Corporate Development 216 (1939)); see also Davis 33.  Were all of these silently excluded from the protections of the First Amendment?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lack of a textual exception for speech by corporations cannot be explained on the ground that such organizations did not exist or did not speak.  To the contrary, colleges, towns and cities, religious institutions, and guilds had long been organized as corporations at common law and under the King\u2019s charter, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 455\u2013473 (1765); 1 S. Kyd, A Treatise on the Law of Corporations 1\u201332, 63 (1793) (reprinted 2006), and as I have discussed, the practice of incorporation only expanded in the United States.  Both corporations and voluntary associations actively petitioned the Government and expressed their views in newspapers and pamphlets.  For example: An antislavery Quaker corporation petitioned the First Congress, distributed pamphlets, and communicated through the press in 1790.  W. diGiacomantonio, \u201cFor the Gratification of a Volunteering Society\u201d: Antislavery and Pressure Group Politics in the First Federal Congress, 15 J. Early Republic 169 (1995).  The New York Sons of Liberty sent a circular to colonies farther south in 1766.  P. Maier, From Resistance to Revolution 79\u201380 (1972).  And the Society for the Relief and Instruction of Poor Germans circulated a biweekly paper from 1755 to 1757.  Adams, The Colonial German-language Press and the American Revolution, in The Press & the American Revolution 151, 161\u2013162 (B. Bailyn & J. Hench eds. 1980).  The dissent offers no evidence\u2014none whatever\u2014that the First Amendment\u2019s unqualified text was originally understood to exclude such associational speech from its protection.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historical evidence relating to the textually similar clause \u201cthe freedom of . . . the press\u201d also provides no support for the proposition that the First Amendment excludes conduct of artificial legal entities from the scope of its protection.  The freedom of \u201cthe press\u201d was widely understood to protect the publishing activities of individual editors and printers.  See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334, 360 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see also McConnell, 540 U. S., at 252\u2013253 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  But these individuals often acted through newspapers, which (much like corporations) had their own names, outlived the individuals who had founded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes owned by more than one person, and were operated for profit.  See generally F. Mott, American Journalism: A History of Newspapers in the United States Through 250 Years 3\u2013164 (1941); J. Smith, Freedom\u2019s Fetters (1956).  Their activities were not stripped of First Amendment protection simply because they were carried out under the banner of an artificial legal entity.  And the notion which follows from the dissent\u2019s view, that modern newspapers, since they are incorporated, have free-speech rights only at the sufferance of Congress, boggles the mind.[Footnote 6]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In passing, the dissent also claims that the Court\u2019s conception of corruption is unhistorical.  The Framers \u201cwould have been appalled,\u201d it says, by the evidence of corruption in the congressional findings supporting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.  Post, at 61.  For this proposition, the dissent cites a law review article arguing that \u201ccorruption\u201d was originally understood to include \u201cmoral decay\u201d and even actions taken by citizens in pursuit of private rather than public ends.  Teachout, The Anti-Corruption Principle, 94 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 341, 373, 378 (2009).  It is hard to see how this has anything to do with what sort of corruption can be combated by restrictions on political speech.  Moreover, if speech can be prohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads to \u201cmoral decay\u201d or does not serve \u201cpublic ends,\u201d then there is no limit to the Government\u2019s censorship power.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent says that when the Framers \u201cconstitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.\u201d  Post, at 37.  That is no doubt true.  All the provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of individual men and women\u2014not, for example, of trees or polar bears.  But the individual person\u2019s right to speak includes the right to speak in association with other individual persons.  Surely the dissent does not believe that speech by the Republican Party or the Democratic Party can be censored because it is not the speech of \u201can individual American.\u201d  It is the speech of many individual Americans, who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the party the right to speak on their behalf.  The association of individuals in a business corporation is no different\u2014or at least it cannot be denied the right to speak on the simplistic ground that it is not \u201can individual American.\u201d[Footnote 7]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to return to, and summarize, my principal point, which is the conformity of today\u2019s opinion with the original meaning of the First Amendment.  The Amendment is written in terms of \u201cspeech,\u201d not speakers.  Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from single individuals to partnerships of individuals, to unincorporated associations of individuals, to incorporated associations of individuals\u2014and the dissent offers no evidence about the original meaning of the text to support any such exclusion.  We are therefore simply left with the question whether the speech at issue in this case is \u201cspeech\u201d covered by the First Amendment.  No one says otherwise.  A documentary film critical of a potential Presidential candidate is core political speech, and its nature as such does not change simply because it was funded by a corporation.  Nor does the character of that funding produce any reduction whatever in the \u201cinherent worth of the speech\u201d and \u201cits capacity for informing the public,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 777 (1978).  Indeed, to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy.  We should celebrate rather than condemn the addition of this speech to the public debate.\n\u00a0Justice Thomas does not join Part IV of the Court\u2019s opinion.\n\u00a0The dissent protests that 1791 rather than 1800 should be the relevant date, and that \u201c[m]ore than half of the century\u2019s total business charters were issued between 1796 and 1800.\u201d  Post, at 35, n. 53.  I used 1800 only because the dissent did.  But in any case, it is surely fanciful to think that a consensus of hostility towards corporations was transformed into general favor at some magical moment between 1791 and 1796.\n\u00a0\u201c[P]eople in 1800 identified corporations with franchised monopolies.\u201d L.\u2002Friedman, A History of American Law 194 (2d ed. 1985) (hereinafter Friedman).  \u201cThe chief cause for the changed popular attitude towards business corporations that marked the opening of the nineteenth century was the elimination of their inherent monopolistic character.  This was accomplished primarily by an extension of the principle of free incorporation under general laws.\u201d  1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \u00a72, p.\u00a08 (rev. ed. 2006).  \n\u00a0At times (though not always) the dissent seems to exclude such non-\u201cbusiness corporations\u201d from its denial of free speech rights.  See post, at 37.  Finding in a seemingly categorical text a distinction between the rights of business corporations and the rights of non-business corporations is even more imaginative than finding a distinction between the rights of all corporations and the rights of other associations.\n\u00a0The best the dissent can come up with is that \u201c[p]ostratification practice\u201d supports its reading of the First Amendment.  Post, at 40, n.\u00a056.  For this proposition, the dissent cites Justice White\u2019s statement (in dissent) that \u201c[t]he common law was generally interpreted as prohibiting corporate political participation,\u201d First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 819 (1978).  The sole authority Justice White cited for this proposition, id., at 819, n.\u00a014, was a law-review note that made no such claim.  To the contrary, it stated that the cases dealing with the propriety of corporate political expenditures were \u201cfew.\u201d  Note, Corporate Political Affairs Programs, 70 Yale L.\u00a0J. 821, 852 (1961).  More specifically, the note cites only two holdings to that effect, one by a Federal District Court, and one by the Supreme Court of Montana.  Id., at 852, n. 197.  Of course even if the common law was \u201cgenerally interpreted\u201d to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires, that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that were authorized by a corporation\u2019s charter could constitutionally be suppressed.  \n\n\nAs additional \u201c[p]ostratification practice,\u201d the dissent notes that the Court \u201cdid not recognize any First Amendment protections for corporations until the middle part of the 20th century.\u201d  Post, at 40, n.\u00a056.  But it did that in Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936), a case involving freedom of the press\u2014which the dissent acknowledges did cover corporations from the outset.  The relative recency of that first case is unsurprising.  All of our First Amendment jurisprudence was slow to develop.  We did not consider application of the First Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until 1919, see Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919); we did not invalidate a state law on First Amendment grounds until 1931, see Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931), and a federal law until 1965, see Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965).\n\u00a0The dissent seeks to avoid this conclusion (and to turn a liability into an asset) by interpreting the Freedom of the Press Clause to refer to the institutional press (thus demonstrating, according to the dissent, that the Founders \u201cdid draw distinctions\u2014explicit distinctions\u2014between types of \u2018speakers,\u2019 or speech outlets or forms\u00a0\u201d).  Post, at 40 and n. 57.  It is passing strange to interpret the phrase \u201cthe freedom of speech, or of the press\u201d to mean, not everyone\u2019s right to speak or publish, but rather everyone\u2019s right to speak or the institutional press\u2019s right to publish.  No one thought that is what it meant.  Patriot Noah Webster\u2019s 1828 dictionary contains, under the word \u201cpress,\u201d the following entry:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cLiberty of the press, in civil policy, is the free right of publishing books, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unrestrained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and opinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious to morals or to the peace of the state.\u201d  2 American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court\u2019s opinion describes, ante, at 36, our jurisprudence agrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals.  It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. . . . The press in its historical connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion.\u201d  Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 452 (1938).\n\u00a0The dissent says that \u201c\u00a0\u2018speech\u2019\u00a0\u201d refers to oral communications of human beings, and since corporations are not human beings they cannot speak.  Post, at 37, n. 55.  This is sophistry.  The authorized spokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of the human beings who have formed that association\u2014just as the spokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its members.  The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to speak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no problem with a corporation\u2019s enjoying the freedom of the press.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same footnote asserts that \u201cit has been \u2018claimed that the notion of institutional speech . . . did not exist in post-revolutionary America.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  This is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the University of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment Speakers, 100 Nw. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1637, 1654 (2006)), which offers as the sole support for its statement a treatise dealing with government speech, M. Yudof, When Government Speaks 42\u201350 (1983).  The cited pages of that treatise provide no support whatever for the statement\u2014unless, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the \u201cinstitutional speech\u201d referred to was speech by the subject of the law-review article, governmental institutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other authority cited in the footnote, a law-review article by a professor at Washington and Lee Law School, Bezanson, Institutional Speech, 80 Iowa L.\u00a0Rev. 735, 775 (1995), in fact contradicts the dissent, in that it would accord free-speech protection to associations."}, {"id": 1732, "title": "Concurring opinion", "author": null, "type": {"value": "concurring", "label": "Concurring opinion"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1963049, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/08-205/concurrence.html", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1732", "justia_text": "CITIZENS UNITED, APPELLANT v. FEDERAL\nELECTION COMMISSION\non appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia\n[January 21, 2010]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech.  It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern.  Its theory, if accepted, would empower the Government to prohibit newspapers from running editorials or opinion pieces supporting or opposing candidates for office, so long as the newspapers were owned by corporations\u2014as the major ones are.  First Amendment rights could be confined to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse that is at the foundation of our democracy.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its opinion in full.  The First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer.  I write separately to address the important principles of judicial restraint and stare decisis implicated in this case.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform.\u201d  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 147\u2013148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring).  Because the stakes are so high, our standard practice is to refrain from addressing constitutional questions except when necessary to rule on particular claims before us.  See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346\u2013348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  This policy underlies both our willingness to construe ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional problems and our practice \u201c\u00a0\u2018never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960) (quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.\u00a0S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority and dissent are united in expressing allegiance to these principles.  Ante, at 12; post, at 14 (Stevens,\u00a0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  But I cannot agree with my dissenting colleagues on how these principles apply in this case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s step-by-step analysis accords with our standard practice of avoiding broad constitutional questions except when necessary to decide the case before us.  The majority begins by addressing\u2014and quite properly rejecting\u2014Citizens United\u2019s statutory claim that 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b does not actually cover its production and distribution of Hillary: The Movie (hereinafter Hillary).  If there were a valid basis for deciding this statutory claim in Citizens United\u2019s favor (and thereby avoiding constitutional adjudication), it would be proper to do so.  Indeed, that is precisely the approach the Court took just last Term in Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___ (2009), when eight Members of the Court agreed to decide the case on statutory grounds instead of reaching the appellant\u2019s broader argument that the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is only because the majority rejects Citizens United\u2019s statutory claim that it proceeds to consider the group\u2019s various constitutional arguments, beginning with its narrowest claim (that Hillary is not the functional equivalent of express advocacy) and proceeding to its broadest claim (that Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990) should be overruled).  This is the same order of operations followed by the controlling opinion in Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL).  There the appellant was able to prevail on its narrowest constitutional argument because its broadcast ads did not qualify as the functional equivalent of express advocacy; there was thus no need to go on to address the broader claim that McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93 (2003), should be overruled.  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 482; id., at 482\u2013483 (Alito, J., concurring).  This case is different\u2014not, as the dissent suggests, because the approach taken in WRTL has been deemed a \u201cfailure,\u201d post, at 11, but because, in the absence of any valid narrower ground of decision, there is no way to avoid Citizens United\u2019s broader constitutional argument.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citizens United\u2019s claims that I find quite perplexing.  It presumably agrees with the majority that Citizens United\u2019s narrower statutory and constitutional arguments lack merit\u2014otherwise its conclusion that the group should lose this case would make no sense.  Despite agreeing that these narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent argues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitutional question of whether Austin remains good law.  It even suggests that the Court\u2019s failure to adopt one of these concededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority is not \u201cserious about judicial restraint.\u201d  Post, at 16.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach is based on a false premise: that our practice of avoiding unnecessary (and unnecessarily broad) constitutional holdings somehow trumps our obligation faithfully to interpret the law.  It should go without saying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right.  Thus while it is true that \u201c[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,\u201d post, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it is necessary to decide more.  There is a difference between judicial restraint and judicial abdication.  When constitutional questions are \u201cindispensably necessary\u201d to resolving the case at hand, \u201cthe court must meet and decide them.\u201d  Ex parte Randolph, 20 F.\u00a0Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11, 558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.\u00a0J.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because it is necessary to reach Citizens United\u2019s broader argument that Austin should be overruled, the debate over whether to consider this claim on an as-applied or facial basis strikes me as largely beside the point.  Citizens United has standing\u2014it is being injured by the Government\u2019s enforcement of the Act.  Citizens United has a constitutional claim\u2014the Act violates the First Amendment, because it prohibits political speech.  The Government has a defense\u2014the Act may be enforced, consistent with the First Amendment, against corporations.  Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the question before us.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no difference of any substance whether this case is resolved by invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to Citizens United.  Even if considered in as-applied terms, a holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to Citizens United\u2014because corporations as well as individuals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights\u2014would mean that any other corporation raising the same challenge would also win.  Likewise, a conclusion that the Act may be applied to Citizens United\u2014because it is constitutional to prohibit corporate political speech\u2014would similarly govern future cases.  Regardless whether we label Citizens United\u2019s claim a \u201cfacial\u201d or \u201cas-applied\u201d challenge, the consequences of the Court\u2019s decision are the same.[Footnote 1]\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text and purpose of the First Amendment point in the same direction: Congress may not prohibit political speech, even if the speaker is a corporation or union.  What makes this case difficult is the need to confront our prior decision in Austin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is the first case in which we have been asked to overrule Austin, and thus it is also the first in which we have had reason to consider how much weight to give stare decisis in assessing its continued validity.  The dissent erroneously declares that the Court \u201creaffirmed\u201d Austin\u2019s holding in subsequent cases\u2014namely, Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. 146 (2003); McConnell; and WRTL.  Post, at 48\u201350.  Not so.  Not a single party in any of those cases asked us to overrule Austin, and as the dissent points out, post, at 4\u20136, the Court generally does not consider constitutional arguments that have not properly been raised.  Austin\u2019s validity was therefore not directly at issue in the cases the dissent cites.  The Court\u2019s unwillingness to overturn Austin in those cases cannot be understood as a reaffirmation of that decision.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fidelity to precedent\u2014the policy of stare decisis\u2014is vital to the proper exercise of the judicial function.  \u201cStare decisis is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  For these reasons, we have long recognized that departures from precedent are inappropriate in the absence of a \u201cspecial justification.\u201d  Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, stare decisis is neither an \u201cinexorable command,\u201d Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 577 (2003), nor \u201ca mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision,\u201d  Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940), especially in constitutional cases, see United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978).  If it were, segregation would be legal, minimum wage laws would be unconstitutional, and the Government could wiretap ordinary criminal suspects without first obtaining warrants.  See Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937); Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967).  As the dissent properly notes, none of us has viewed stare decisis in such absolute terms.  Post, at 17; see also, e.g., Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 274\u2013281 (2006) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (urging the Court to overrule its invalidation of limits on independent expenditures on political speech in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stare decisis is instead a \u201cprinciple of policy.\u201d Helvering, supra, at 119.  When considering whether to reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the importance of having constitutional questions decided against the importance of having them decided right.  As Justice Jackson explained, this requires a \u201csober appraisal of the disadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.\u201d  Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare Decisis, 30 A.\u00a0B.\u00a0A. J. 334 (1944).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conducting this balancing, we must keep in mind that stare decisis is not an end in itself.  It is instead \u201cthe means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.\u201d  Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986).  Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal\u2014the rule of law.  It follows that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration itself departed from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, returning to the \u201c \u2018intrinsically sounder\u2019 doctrine established in prior cases\u201d may \u201cbetter serv[e] the values of stare decisis than would following [the] more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it.\u201d  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 231 (1995); see also Helvering, supra, at 119; Randall, supra, at 274 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Abrogating the errant precedent, rather than reaffirming or extending it, might better preserve the law\u2019s coherence and curtail the precedent\u2019s disruptive effects.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, if adherence to a precedent actually impedes the stable and orderly adjudication of future cases, its stare decisis effect is also diminished.  This can happen in a number of circumstances, such as when the precedent\u2019s validity is so hotly contested that it cannot reliably function as a basis for decision in future cases, when its rationale threatens to upend our settled jurisprudence in related areas of law, and when the precedent\u2019s underlying reasoning has become so discredited that the Court cannot keep the precedent alive without jury-rigging new and different justifications to shore up the original mistake.  See, e.g., Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10); Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13) (stare decisis does not control when adherence to the prior decision requires \u201cfundamentally revising its theoretical basis\u201d).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations weigh against retaining our decision in Austin.  First, as the majority explains, that decision was an \u201caberration\u201d insofar as it departed from the robust protections we had granted political speech in our earlier cases.  Ante, at 39; see also Buckley, supra; First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978).  Austin undermined the careful line that Buckley drew to distinguish limits on contributions to candidates from limits on independent expenditures on speech.  Buckley rejected the asserted government interest in regulating independent expenditures, concluding that \u201crestrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u201d  424 U. S., at 48\u201349; see also Bellotti, supra, at 790\u2013791; Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 295 (1981).  Austin, however, allowed the Government to prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth\u201d in the marketplace of ideas.  494 U. S., at 660.  Austin\u2019s reasoning was\u2014and remains\u2014inconsistent with Buckley\u2019s explicit repudiation of any government interest in \u201cequalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d  424 U. S., at 48\u201349.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin was also inconsistent with Bellotti\u2019s clear rejection of the idea that \u201cspeech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection simply because its source is a corporation.\u201d  435 U. S., at 784.  The dissent correctly points out that Bellotti involved a referendum rather than a candidate election, and that Bellotti itself noted this factual distinction, id., at 788, n. 26; post, at 52.  But this distinction does not explain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on speech in candidate elections when individuals may not.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the validity of Austin\u2019s rationale\u2014itself adopted over two \u201cspirited dissents,\u201d Payne, 501 U. S., at 829\u2014has proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Members of this Court ever since.  See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S., at 483 (Scalia, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 247, 264, 286 (opinions of Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy, JJ.); Beaumont, 539 U. S., at 163, 164 (opinions of Kennedy and Thomas, JJ.).  The simple fact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of course, insufficient to justify overruling it.  But it does undermine the precedent\u2019s ability to contribute to the stable and orderly development of the law.  In such circumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Court\u2014which in this case is squarely asked to reconsider Austin\u2019s validity for the first time\u2014to address the matter with a greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the Austin decision is uniquely destabilizing because it threatens to subvert our Court\u2019s decisions even outside the particular context of corporate express advocacy.  The First Amendment theory underlying Austin\u2019s holding is extraordinarily broad.  Austin\u2019s logic would authorize government prohibition of political speech by a category of speakers in the name of equality\u2014a point that most scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that the dissent denies.  Compare, e.g., Garrett, New Voices in Politics: Justice Marshall\u2019s Jurisprudence on Law and Politics, 52 Howard L.\u00a0J. 655, 669 (2009) (Austin \u201chas been understood by most commentators to be an opinion driven by equality considerations, albeit disguised in the language of \u2018political corruption\u2019 \u201d) with post, at 74 (Austin\u2019s rationale \u201cis manifestly not just an \u2018equalizing\u2019 ideal in disguise\u201d).[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It should not be surprising, then, that Members of the Court have relied on Austin\u2019s expansive logic to justify greater incursions on the First Amendment, even outside the original context of corporate advocacy on behalf of candidates running for office.  See, e.g., Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 7\u20138) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (relying on Austin and other cases to justify restrictions on campaign spending by individual candidates, explaining that \u201cthere is no reason that their logic\u2014specifically, their concerns about the corrosive and distorting effects of wealth on our political process\u2014is not equally applicable in the context of individual wealth\u201d); McConnell, supra, at 203\u2013209 (extending Austin beyond its original context to cover not only the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express advocacy by corporations, but also electioneering speech conducted by labor unions).  The dissent in this case succumbs to the same temptation, suggesting that Austin justifies prohibiting corporate speech because such speech might unduly influence \u201cthe market for legislation.\u201d  Post, at 82.  The dissent reads Austin to permit restrictions on corporate speech based on nothing more than the fact that the corporate form may help individuals coordinate and present their views more effectively.  Post, at 82.  A speaker\u2019s ability to persuade, however, provides no basis for government regulation of free and open public debate on what the laws should be.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If taken seriously, Austin\u2019s logic would apply most directly to newspapers and other media corporations.  They have a more profound impact on public discourse than most other speakers.  These corporate entities are, for the time being, not subject to \u00a7441b\u2019s otherwise generally applicable prohibitions on corporate political speech.  But this is simply a matter of legislative grace.  The fact that the law currently grants a favored position to media corporations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in accepting a theory that would allow government restrictions on their political speech.  See generally McConnell, supra, at 283\u2013286 (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These readings of Austin do no more than carry that decision\u2019s reasoning to its logical endpoint.  In doing so, they highlight the threat Austin poses to First Amendment rights generally, even outside its specific factual context of corporate express advocacy.  Because Austin is so difficult to confine to its facts\u2014and because its logic threatens to undermine our First Amendment jurisprudence and the nature of public discourse more broadly\u2014the costs of giving it stare decisis effect are unusually high.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally and most importantly, the Government\u2019s own effort to defend Austin\u2014or, more accurately, to defend something that is not quite Austin\u2014underscores its weakness as a precedent of the Court.  The Government concedes that Austin \u201cis not the most lucid opinion,\u201d yet asks us to reaffirm its holding.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (Sept. 9, 2009).  But while invoking stare decisis to support this position, the Government never once even mentions the compelling interest that Austin relied upon in the first place: the need to diminish \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d  494 U. S., at 660.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of endorsing Austin on its own terms, the Government urges us to reaffirm Austin\u2019s specific holding on the basis of two new and potentially expansive interests\u2014the need to prevent actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption, and the need to protect corporate shareholders.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 8\u201310, 12\u201313.  Those interests may or may not support the result in Austin, but they were plainly not part of the reasoning on which Austin relied.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To its credit, the Government forthrightly concedes that Austin did not embrace either of the new rationales it now urges upon us.  See, e.g., Supp. Brief for Appellee 11 (\u201cThe Court did not decide in Austin \u2026 whether the compelling interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption provides a constitutionally sufficient justification for prohibiting the use of corporate treasury funds for independent electioneering\u201d); Tr. of Oral Arg. 45 (Sept. 9, 2009) (\u201cAustin did not articulate what we believe to be the strongest compelling interest\u201d); id., at 61 (\u201c[The Court:] I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest.  This is a new argument.  [The Government:] I think that that\u2019s fair\u201d); id., at 64 (\u201c[The Court:] In other words, you are asking us to uphold Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted in [the context of limits on political expenditures].  [The Government:] [I]n this particular context, fair enough\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear: The Court in Austin nowhere relied upon the only arguments the Government now raises to support that decision.  In fact, the only opinion in Austin endorsing the Government\u2019s argument based on the threat of quid pro quo corruption was Justice Stevens\u2019s concurrence.  494 U. S., at 678.  The Court itself did not do so, despite the fact that the concurrence highlighted the argument.  Moreover, the Court\u2019s only discussion of shareholder protection in Austin appeared in a section of the opinion that sought merely to distinguish Austin\u2019s facts from those of Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986).  Austin, supra, at 663.  Nowhere did Austin suggest that the goal of protecting shareholders is itself a compelling interest authorizing restrictions on First Amendment rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the Government\u2019s case for reaffirming Austin depends on radically reconceptualizing its reasoning, that argument is at odds with itself.  Stare decisis is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation.  It counsels deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification for making new ones.  There is therefore no basis for the Court to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has never accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to support a conclusion reached on different grounds that have since been abandoned or discredited.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that justify stare decisis in the first place.  It would effectively license the Court to invent and adopt new principles of constitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing its past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those principles have merit on their own.  This approach would allow the Court\u2019s past missteps to spawn future mistakes, undercutting the very rule-of-law values that stare decisis is designed to protect.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of this is to say that the Government is barred from making new arguments to support the outcome in Austin.  On the contrary, it is free to do so.  And of course the Court is free to accept them.  But the Government\u2019s new arguments must stand or fall on their own; they are not entitled to receive the special deference we accord to precedent.  They are, as grounds to support Austin, literally unprecedented.  Moreover, to the extent the Government relies on new arguments\u2014and declines to defend Austin on its own terms\u2014we may reasonably infer that it lacks confidence in that decision\u2019s original justification.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because continued adherence to Austin threatens to subvert the \u201cprincipled and intelligible\u201d development of our First Amendment jurisprudence, Vasquez, 474 U. S., at 265, I support the Court\u2019s determination to overrule that decision.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have had two rounds of briefing in this case, two oral arguments, and 54 amicus briefs to help us carry out our obligation to decide the necessary constitutional questions according to law.  We have also had the benefit of a comprehensive dissent that has helped ensure that the Court has considered all the relevant issues.  This careful consideration convinces me that Congress violates the First Amendment when it decrees that some speakers may not engage in political speech at election time, when it matters most.\n\u00a0The dissent suggests that I am \u201cmuch too quick\u201d to reach this conclusion because I \u201cignore\u201d Citizens United\u2019s narrower arguments.  Post, at 13, n.\u00a012.  But in fact I do not ignore those arguments; on the contrary, I (and my colleagues in the majority) appropriately consider and reject them on their merits, before addressing Citizens United\u2019s broader claims.

Corporations and unions may establish a political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneering communications purposes.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(2).  In McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 203\u2013209, this Court upheld limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of then-Senator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party\u2019s Presidential nomination.  Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast and cable television.  Concerned about possible civil and criminal penalties for violating \u00a7441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that (1) \u00a7441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA\u2019s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements, BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and the ads.  The District Court denied Citizens United a preliminary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission (FEC) summary judgment. \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Because the question whether \u00a7441b applies to Hillary cannot be resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech, this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in Austin.

Citizens United did not waive this challenge to Austin when it stipulated to dismissing the facial challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived, this Court may reconsider Austin and \u00a7441b\u2019s facial validity here because the District Court \u201cpassed upon\u201d the issue, Lebron v.

S. 374, 379; (2) throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Because Citizen United\u2019s narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider \u00a7441b\u2019s facial validity.  Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide chilling effect caused by \u00a7441b\u2019s corporate expenditure ban.  This conclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty caused by the Government\u2019s litigating position; (2) substantial time would be required to clarify \u00a7441b\u2019s application on the points raised by the Government\u2019s position in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is of primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any speech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating political speech is chilled.  The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a prior restraint in the strict sense.  However, given its complexity and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak.  The restrictions thus function as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power analogous to the type of government practices that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.   The ongoing chill on speech makes it necessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.  Pp.\u00a012\u201320.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Austin is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.  Hence, \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be applied to Hillary.  Given this conclusion, the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA \u00a7203\u2019s extension of \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on independent corporate expenditures is also overruled.  Pp.\u00a020\u201351.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Although the First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech,\u201d \u00a7441b\u2019s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech, backed by criminal sanctions.  It is a ban notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a separate association from the corporation.  Because speech is an essential mechanism of democracy\u2014it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people\u2014political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it by design or inadvertence.  Laws burdening such speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \u201cfurthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\u201d WRTL, 551 U. S., at 464.  This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting the interests in this case.  Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speakers, which may be a means to control content.  The Government may also commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.  There is no basis for the proposition that, in the political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.  Both history and logic lead to this conclusion.  Pp.\u00a020\u201325.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428\u2013429.  Addressing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the Buckley Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.  424 U. S., at 25\u201326.  However, the Court invalidated \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals, corporations, and unions, because it \u201cfail[ed] to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\u201d id., at 47\u201348.  While Buckley did not consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures found in \u00a7610, had that provision been challenged in Buckley\u2019s wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent\u2019s reasoning and analysis.  The Buckley Court did not invoke the overbreadth doctrine to suggest that \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure ban would have been constitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not individuals.   Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified \u00a7610\u2019s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b, the provision at issue.  Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the power to restrict political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  435 U.S., at 784\u2013785.  Thus the law stood until Austin upheld a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing Buckley and Bellotti by recognizing a new governmental interest in preventing \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth \u2026 that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d  494 U. S., at 660.  Pp.\u00a025\u201332.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-Austin line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity and a post-Austin line permitting them.  Neither Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale nor the Government\u2019s other justifications support \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions.  Pp.\u00a032\u201347.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political speech, but Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale would permit the Government to ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corporate form.  Political speech is \u201cindispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation.\u201d  Bellotti, supra, at 777 (footnote omitted).  This protection is inconsistent with Austin\u2019s rationale, which is meant to prevent corporations from obtaining \u201c\u00a0\u2018an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\u2019\u00a0\u201d by using \u201c\u00a0\u2018resources amassed in the economic marketplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  494 U. S., at 659.  First Amendment protections do not depend on the speaker\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\u201d  Buckley, supra, at 49.  These conclusions were reaffirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. ___, ___.  Distinguishing wealthy individuals from corporations based on the latter\u2019s special advantages of, e.g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting speech.  It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate funds may \u201chave little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d Austin, supra, at 660.  All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the resulting speech.  Under the antidistortion rationale, Congress could also ban political speech of media corporations.  Although currently exempt from \u00a7441b, they accumulate wealth with the help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth, and may express views \u201chav[ing] little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support\u201d for those views.  Differential treatment of media corporations and other corporations cannot be squared with the First Amendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amendment\u2019s original meaning would permit suppressing media corporations\u2019 political speech.  Austin interferes with the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208.  Its censorship is vast in its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit, both small and large, corporations.  Pp.\u00a032\u201340.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Government\u2019s other arguments.  It reasons that corporate political speech can be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance.  The Buckley Court found this rationale \u201csufficiently important\u201d to allow contribution limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits, 424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here.   While a single Bellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  That speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt.  And the appearance of influence or access will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy.  Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished.

The statute is underinclusive; it only protects a dissenting shareholder\u2019s interests in certain media for 30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be implicated in any media at any time.  It is also overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder.  P. 46. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4)\u00a0Because \u00a7441b is not limited to corporations or associations created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recognize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence over the Nation\u2019s political process.  Pp.\u00a046\u201347.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare decisis, beyond workability\u2014the precedent\u2019s antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned\u2014counsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the precedents of Buckley and Bellotti.  As already explained, Austin was not well reasoned.  It is also undermined by experience since its announcement.  Political speech is so ingrained in this country\u2019s culture that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws.  Rapid changes in technology\u2014and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression\u2014counsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  In addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake.  Thus, due consideration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled.   The Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.  Pp.\u00a047\u201350.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for Hillary and to the movie itself.  Pp.\u00a050\u201357.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \u201cimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\u201d Buckley, 424 U.

The Buckley Court explained that disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing \u201cthe electorate with information\u201d about election-related spending sources.  The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  However, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable probability\u2019\u00a0\u201d that disclosing its contributors\u2019 names would \u201c\u00a0\u2018subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 198.  Pp.\u00a050\u201352.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Citizens United\u2019s ads.  They fall within BCRA\u2019s \u201celectioneering communication\u201d definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy.  Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and \u201cinsure that the voters are fully informed\u201d about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76.  At the very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.  Citizens United\u2019s arguments that \u00a7311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that \u00a7311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group\u2019s speech were rejected in McConnell.  This Court also rejects their contention that \u00a7201\u2019s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTL\u2019s test for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469\u2013476 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).  Disclosure is the less-restrictive alternative to more comprehensive speech regulations.  Such requirements have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell.  Citizens United\u2019s argument that no informational interest justifies applying \u00a7201 to its ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to disclaimers.  Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or reprisals that might make \u00a7201 unconstitutional as applied.

FEDERAL\nELECTION COMMISSION\non appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia\n[January 21, 2010]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b.  Limits on electioneering communications were upheld in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U. S. 93, 203\u2013209 (2003).  The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent on an earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990).  Austin had held that political speech may be banned based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell.  It has been noted that \u201cAustin was a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles,\u201d Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 490 (2007) (WRTL) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  We agree with that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not compel the continued acceptance of Austin.  The Government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether.  We turn to the case now before us.\nI\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation.  It brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  A three-judge court later convened to hear the cause.  The resulting judgment gives rise to this appeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12 million.  Most of its funds are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corporations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled Hillary: The Movie.  We refer to the film as Hillary.  It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party\u2019s 2008 Presidential primary elections.  Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton.  Hillary was released in theaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to increase distribution by making it available through video-on-demand.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to select programming from various menus, including movies, television shows, sports, news, and music.  The viewer can watch the program at any time and can elect to rewind or pause the program.  In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make Hillary available on a video-on-demand channel called \u201cElections \u201908.\u201d  App. 255a\u2013257a.  Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small fee to view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make Hillary available to viewers free of charge.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for Hillary.  Each ad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie\u2019s Website address.  Id., at 26a\u201327a.  Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand offering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibited\u2014and still does prohibit\u2014corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b (2000 ed.); see McConnell, supra, at 204, and n. 87; Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 249 (1986) (MCFL).  BCRA \u00a7203 amended \u00a7441b to prohibit any \u201celectioneering communication\u201d as well.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.).  An electioneering communication is defined as \u201cany broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\u201d that \u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\u201d and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election.  \u00a7434(f)(3)(A).  The Federal Election Commission\u2019s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as a communication that is \u201cpublicly distributed.\u201d  11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2) (2009).  \u201cIn the case of a candidate for nomination for President \u2026 publicly distributed means\u201d that the communication \u201c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within 30 days.\u201d  \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii).  Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or electioneering communications.  They may establish, however, a \u201cseparate segregated fund\u201d (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(b)(2).  The moneys received by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union.  Ibid.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary elections.  It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by \u00a7441b\u2019s ban on corporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under \u00a7437g.  In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC.  It argued that (1) \u00a7441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the three ads for the movie.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied Citizens United\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (DC 2008) (per curiam), and then granted the FEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, App. 261a\u2013262a.  See id., at 261a (\u201cBased on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that the [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Citizen[s] United v. FEC, 530 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C. 2008) (denying Citizens United\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction)\u201d).  The court held that \u00a7441b was facially constitutional under McConnell, and that \u00a7441b was constitutional as applied to Hillary because it was \u201csusceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.\u201d  530 F. Supp. 2d, at 279.  The court also rejected Citizens United\u2019s challenge to BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure requirements.  It noted that \u201cthe Supreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though the speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.\u201d  Id., at 281.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We noted probable jurisdiction.  555 U. S. ___ (2008).  The case was reargued in this Court after the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing whether we should overrule either or both Austin and the part of McConnell which addresses the facial validity of 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b.  See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before considering whether Austin should be overruled, we first address whether Citizens United\u2019s claim that \u00a7441b cannot be applied to Hillary may be resolved on other, narrower grounds.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United contends that \u00a7441b does not cover Hillary, as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the film does not qualify as an \u201celectioneering communication.\u201d  \u00a7441b(b)(2).  Citizens United raises this issue for the first time before us, but we consider the issue because \u201cit was addressed by the court below.\u201d  Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995); see 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 277, n.\u00a06.  Under the definition of electioneering communication, the video-on-demand showing of Hillary on cable television would have been a \u201ccable . . . communication\u201d that \u201crefer[red] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office\u201d and that was made within 30 days of a primary election.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7434(f)(3)(A)(i).  Citizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not \u201cpublicly distributed,\u201d because a single video-on-demand transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each separate transmission, in most instances, will be seen by just one household\u2014not 50,000 or more persons.  11 CFR \u00a7100.29(a)(2); see \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument ignores the regulation\u2019s instruction on how to determine whether a cable transmission \u201c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons.\u201d  \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii).  The regulation provides that the number of people who can receive a cable transmission is determined by the number of cable subscribers in the relevant area.  \u00a7\u00a7100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii).  Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide.  App. 256a.  Thus, Hillary could have been received by 50,000 persons or more.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the condition that the communication \u201c[c]an be received by 50,000 or more persons,\u201d \u00a7100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require \u201ca plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed by 50,000 or more potential voters\u201d\u2014as opposed to requiring only that the communication is \u201ctechnologically capable\u201d of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as Amici Curiae 5.  Whether the population and demographic statistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000 registered voters\u2014but not \u201cinfants, pre-teens, or otherwise electorally ineligible recipients\u201d\u2014would be a required determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in any case where the issue was in doubt.  Id., at 6.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the reach of 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b through this suggested interpretation.  In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation, this result would require a calculation as to the number of people a particular communication is likely to reach, with an inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker to criminal sanctions.  The First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing research, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most salient political issues of our day.  Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech: People \u201cof common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the law\u2019s] meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d  Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926).  The Government may not render a ban on political speech constitutional by carving out a limited exemption through an amorphous regulatory interpretation.  We must reject the approach suggested by the amici.  Section 441b covers Hillary.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United next argues that \u00a7441b may not be applied to Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.  McConnell decided that \u00a7441b(b)(2)\u2019s definition of an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d was facially constitutional insofar as it restricted speech that was \u201cthe functional equivalent of express advocacy\u201d for or against a specific candidate.  540 U. S., at 206.  WRTL then found an unconstitutional application of \u00a7441b where the speech was not \u201cexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.\u201d  551 U. S., at 481 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).  As explained by The Chief Justice\u2019s controlling opinion in WRTL, the functional-equivalent test is objective: \u201ca court should find that [a communication] is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\u201d  Id., at 469\u2013470.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advocacy.  The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President.  In light of historical footage, interviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by most viewers as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton\u2019s character and her fitness for the office of the Presidency.  The narrative may contain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is unfit for the Presidency.  The movie concentrates on alleged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration, Senator Clinton\u2019s qualifications and fitness for office, and policies the commentators predict she would pursue if elected President.  It calls Senator Clinton \u201cMachiavellian,\u201d App. 64a, and asks whether she is \u201cthe most qualified to hit the ground running if elected President,\u201d id., at 88a.  The narrator reminds viewers that \u201cAmericans have never been keen on dynasties\u201d and that \u201ca vote for Hillary is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the White House,\u201d id., at 143a\u2013144a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United argues that Hillary is just \u201ca documentary film that examines certain historical events.\u201d  Brief for Appellant 35.  We disagree.  The movie\u2019s consistent emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton\u2019s candidacy for President.  The narrator begins by asking \u201ccould [Senator Clinton] become the first female President in the history of the United States?\u201d  App. 35a.  And the narrator reiterates the movie\u2019s message in his closing line: \u201cFinally, before America decides on our next president, voters should need no reminders of \u2026 what\u2019s at stake\u2014the well being and prosperity of our nation.\u201d  Id., at 144a\u2013145a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the District Court found, there is no reasonable interpretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton.  Under the standard stated in McConnell and further elaborated in WRTL, the film qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  \nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United further contends that \u00a7441b should be invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on-demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads.  Cf. McConnell, supra, at 207.  On what we might call conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unrelated to the advertising.  With video-on-demand, by contrast, the viewer selects a program after taking \u201ca series of affirmative steps\u201d: subscribing to cable; navigating through various menus; and selecting the program.  See Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While some means of communication may be less effective than others at influencing the public in different contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which means of communications are to be preferred for the particular type of message and speaker would raise questions as to the courts\u2019 own lawful authority.  Substantial questions would arise if courts were to begin saying what means of speech should be preferred or disfavored.  And in all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid flux.  See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 639 (1994).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment.  We must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker.  It must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First Amendment flaws.  The interpretive process itself would create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end, would themselves be questionable.  First Amendment standards, however, \u201cmust give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (citing New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269\u2013270 (1964)).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political speech funded overwhelmingly by individuals.  As an alternative to reconsidering Austin, the Government also seems to prefer this approach.  This line of analysis, however, would be unavailing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In MCFL, the Court found unconstitutional \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to nonprofit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose of promoting political ideas, did not engage in business activities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit corporations or labor unions.  479 U. S., at 263\u2013264; see also 11 CFR \u00a7114.10.  BCRA\u2019s so-called Wellstone Amendment applied \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban to all nonprofit corporations.  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(c)(6); McConnell, 540 U. S., at 209.  McConnell then interpreted the Wellstone Amendment to retain the MCFL exemption to \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure prohibition.  540 U. S., at 211.  Citizens United does not qualify for the MCFL exemption, however, since some funds used to make the movie were donations from for-profit corporations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government suggests we could find BCRA\u2019s Wellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the statute, and hold that Citizens United\u2019s speech is exempt from \u00a7441b\u2019s ban under BCRA\u2019s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, \u00a7441b(c)(2).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338 (Sept. 9, 2009).  The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a backup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone Amendment is invalidated.  See McConnell, supra, at 339 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would exempt from \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban the political speech of certain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded \u201cexclusively\u201d by individual donors and the funds were maintained in a segregated account.  \u00a7441b(c)(2).  Citizens United would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemption, under its terms as written, because Hillary was funded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argument, the Court would be required to revise the text of MCFL, sever BCRA\u2019s Wellstone Amendment, \u00a7441b(c)(6), and ignore the plain text of BCRA\u2019s Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, \u00a7441b(c)(2).  If the Court decided to create a de minimis exception to MCFL or the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corporate general treasury funds to be spent for independent expenditures that support candidates.  There is no principled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin\u2019s holding that the Government can restrict corporate independent expenditures for political speech.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though it is true that the Court should construe statutes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view of the language of the statute.  In addition to those difficulties the Government\u2019s suggestion is troubling for still another reason.  The Government does not say that it agrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 3, n.\u00a01 (\u201cSome courts\u201d have implied a de minimis exception, and \u201cappellant would appear to be covered by these decisions\u201d).  Presumably it would find textual difficulties in this approach too.  The Government, like any party, can make arguments in the alternative; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative proposal instead of merely suggesting it.  This is especially true in the context of the First Amendment.  As the Government stated, this case \u201cwould require a remand\u201d to apply a de minimis standard.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9, 2009).  Applying this standard would thus require case-by-case determinations.  But archetypical political speech would be chilled in the meantime.  \u201c\u00a0\u2018First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  WRTL, supra, at 468\u2013469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963)).  We decline to adopt an interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case determinations to verify whether political speech is banned, especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corporation has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.\nE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment.  See Morse v. Frederick, 551 U. S. 393, 403 (2007).  It is not judicial restraint to accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can avoid another argument with broader implications.  Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader ruling.  Here, the lack of a valid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consideration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression upheld in Austin.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its complaint, which raised a facial challenge to \u00a7441b, even though count 3 raised an as-applied challenge.  See App. 23a (count 3: \u201cAs applied to Hillary, [\u00a7441b] is unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free expression and association\u201d).  The Government argues that Citizens United waived its challenge to Austin by dismissing count 5.  We disagree.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that would not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or addressing the facial validity of \u00a7441b in this case.  \u201cOur practice \u2018permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has been passed upon . . . .\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Lebron, 513 U. S., at 379 (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 41 (1992); first alteration in original).  And here, the District Court addressed Citizens United\u2019s facial challenge.  See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (\u201cCitizens wants us to enjoin the operation of BCRA \u00a7203 as a facially unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom of speech\u201d).  In rejecting the claim, it noted that it \u201cwould have to overrule McConnell\u201d for Citizens United to prevail on its facial challenge and that \u201c[o]nly the Supreme Court may overrule its decisions.\u201d  Ibid. (citing Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989)).  The District Court did not provide much analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in Austin or McConnell.  Even so, the District Court did \u201c\u00a0\u2018pas[s] upon\u2019\u00a0\u201d the issue.  Lebron, supra, at 379.  Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s later opinion, which granted the FEC summary judgment, was \u201c[b]ased on the reasoning of [its] prior opinion,\u201d which included the discussion of the facial challenge.  App. 261a (citing 530 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 274).  After the District Court addressed the facial validity of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to Austin in this Court.  See Brief for Appellant 30 (\u201cAustin was wrongly decided and should be overruled\u201d); id., at 30\u201332.  In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider Citizens United\u2019s challenge to Austin and the facial validity of \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.  All concede that this claim is properly before us.  And \u201c\u00a0\u2018[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Lebron, supra, at 379 (quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992); alteration in original).  Citizens United\u2019s argument that Austin should be overruled is \u201cnot a new claim.\u201d  Lebron, 513 U. S., at 379.  Rather, it is\u2014at most\u2014\u201ca new argument to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied challenges is not so well defined that it has some automatic effect or that it must always control the pleadings and disposition in every case involving a constitutional challenge.  The distinction is both instructive and necessary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint.  See United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 477\u2013478 (1995) (contrasting \u201ca facial challenge\u201d with \u201ca narrower remedy\u201d).  The parties cannot enter into a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering certain remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim that has been preserved.  Citizens United has preserved its First Amendment challenge to \u00a7441b as applied to the facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we cannot easily address that issue without assuming a premise\u2014the permissibility of restricting corporate political speech\u2014that is itself in doubt.  See Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\u201c[O]nce a case is brought, no general categorical line bars a court from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \u2018as-applied\u2019 cases\u201d); id., at 1327\u20131328.  As our request for supplemental briefing implied, Citizens United\u2019s claim implicates the validity of Austin, which in turn implicates the facial validity of \u00a7441b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the statute now at issue came before the Court in McConnell, both the majority and the dissenting opinions considered the question of its facial validity.  The holding and validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of the McConnell majority opinion, which upheld BCRA\u2019s extension of \u00a7441b.  See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin, 494 U. S., at 660).  McConnell permitted federal felony punishment for speech by all corporations, including nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly before federal elections.  See 540 U. S., at 203\u2013209.  Four Members of the McConnell Court would have overruled Austin, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined the Court\u2019s opinion in Austin but reconsidered that conclusion.  See 540 U. S., at 256\u2013262 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 273\u2013275 (Thomas, J., concurring in part, concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 322\u2013338 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, J.).  That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was facilitated by the extensive record, which was \u201cover 100,000 pages\u201d long, made in the three-judge District Court.  McConnell v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (McConnell I).  It is not the case, then, that the Court today is premature in interpreting \u00a7441b \u201c\u00a0\u2018on the basis of [a] factually barebones recor[d].\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The McConnell majority considered whether the statute was facially invalid.  An as-applied challenge was brought in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 546 U. S. 410, 411\u2013412 (2006) (per curiam), and the Court confirmed that the challenge could be maintained.  Then, in WRTL, the controlling opinion of the Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but  also sustained it.  Three Justices noted that they would continue to maintain the position that the record in McConnell demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its face.  551 U. S., at 485\u2013504 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The controlling opinion in WRTL, which refrained from holding the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the essential elements of the Court\u2019s opinion in McConnell, while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made by the WRTL parties.  551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, Citizens United\u2019s narrower arguments are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute.  In the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for the Court to consider the facial validity of \u00a7441b.  Any other course of decision would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by \u00a7441b\u2019s prohibitions on corporate expenditures.  Consideration of the facial validity of \u00a7441b is further supported by the following reasons.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position of the Government.  As discussed above, see Part II\u2013D, supra, the Government suggests, as an alternative argument, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.  This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit corporation involved here may have received only de minimis donations from for-profit corporations and that some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the operation of the statute.  The Government also suggests that an as-applied challenge to \u00a7441b\u2019s ban on books may be successful, although it would defend \u00a7441b\u2019s ban as applied to almost every other form of media including pamphlets.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65\u201366 (Sept. 9, 2009).  The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to the uncertainty that \u00a7441b causes.  When the Government holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position, the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to address the question of statutory validity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, substantial time would be required to bring clarity to the application of the statutory provision on these points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by some improper interpretation.  See Part II\u2013C, supra.  It is well known that the public begins to concentrate on elections only in the weeks immediately before they are held.  There are short timeframes in which speech can have influence.  The need or relevance of the speech will often first be apparent at this stage in the campaign.  The decision to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns, when speakers react to messages conveyed by others.  A speaker\u2019s ability to engage in political speech that could have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker must first commence a protracted lawsuit.  By the time the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor, perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could establish that the case is not moot because the issue is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d  WRTL, supra, at 462 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911)).  Here, Citizens United decided to litigate its case to the end.  Today, Citizens United finally learns, two years after the fact, whether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential primary\u2014long after the opportunity to persuade primary voters has passed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the integrity of the election process.  As additional rules are created for regulating political speech, any speech arguably within their reach is chilled.  See Part II\u2013A, supra.  Campaign finance regulations now impose \u201cunique and complex rules\u201d on \u201c71 distinct entities.\u201d  Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 11\u201312.  These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different types of political speech.  Id., at 14\u201315, n.\u00a010.  The FEC has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanations and justifications for those regulations, and 1,771 advisory opinions since 1975.  See id., at 6, n.\u00a07.  In fact, after this Court in WRTL adopted an objective \u201cappeal to vote\u201d test for determining whether a communication was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.), the FEC adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement WRTL\u2019s ruling.  See 11 CFR \u00a7114.15; Brief for Wyoming Liberty Group et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 17\u201327 (filed Jan. 15, 2009).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place.  Cf. Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 712\u2013713 (1931).  As a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the regulations and the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permission to speak.  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7437f; 11 CFR \u00a7112.1.  These onerous restrictions thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.  See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534 U. S. 316, 320 (2002); Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 451\u2013452 (1938); Near, supra, at 713\u2013714.  Because the FEC\u2019s \u201cbusiness is to censor, there inheres the danger that [it] may well be less responsive than a court\u2014part of an independent branch of government\u2014to the constitutionally protected interests in free expression.\u201d  Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57\u201358 (1965).  When the FEC issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, \u201c[m]any persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden (and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from protected speech\u2014harming not only themselves but society as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.\u201d  Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119 (2003) (citation omitted).  Consequently, \u201cthe censor\u2019s determination may in practice be final.\u201d  Freedman, supra, at 58.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is precisely what WRTL sought to avoid.  WRTL said that First Amendment standards \u201cmust eschew \u2018the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,\u2019 which \u2018invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.) (quoting Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original).  Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by applying ambiguous tests.  If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question.  Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11-factor test they have promulgated.  This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of speech.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has been demonstrated.  See WRTL, supra, at 482\u2013483 (Alito, J., concurring); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97\u201398 (1940).  For these reasons we find it necessary to reconsider Austin.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  Laws enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at different points in the speech process.  The following are just a few examples of restrictions that have been attempted at different stages of the speech process\u2014all laws found to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the outset, Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N.\u00a0Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 153 (2002); imposing a burden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties, Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.\u00a0Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 108, 123 (1991); seeking to exact a cost after the speech occurs, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 267; and subjecting the speaker to criminal penalties, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 445 (1969) (per curiam).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.  Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations\u2014including nonprofit advocacy corporations\u2014either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election.  Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under \u00a7441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association publishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presidential candidate in light of that candidate\u2019s defense of\nfree speech.  These prohibitions are classic examples of censorship.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 330\u2013333 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  A PAC is a separate association from the corporation.  So the PAC exemption from \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban, \u00a7441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.  Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak\u2014and it does not\u2014the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with \u00a7441b.  PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.  For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve receipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within 10 days.  See id., at 330\u2013332 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 253\u2013254).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that is just the beginning.  PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different times depending on the type of election that is about to occur:\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018These reports must contain information regarding the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of receipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identification of each political committee and candidate\u2019s authorized or affiliated committee making contributions, and any persons making loans, providing rebates, refunds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to operating expenditures in an aggregate amount over $200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggregating over $200 have been made; persons to whom loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total sum of all contributions, operating expenses, outstanding debts and obligations, and the settlement terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  540 U. S., at 331\u2013332 (quoting MCFL, supra, at 253\u2013254).\n\nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to\nspeak.  This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the millions of corporations in this country have PACs.\nSee Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et\u00a0al. as\nAmici Curiae 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity 1990\u20132006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/\n20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income: 2006, Corporation Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinafter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns).  PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak.  Given the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views known regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 441b\u2019s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech.  As a \u201crestriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign,\u201d that statute \u201cnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\u201d  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 19 (1976) (per curiam).  Were the Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various points in the speech process.  See McConnell, supra, at 251 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (Government could repress speech by \u201cattacking all levels of the production and dissemination of ideas,\u201d for \u201ceffective public communication requires the speaker to make use of the services of others\u201d).  If \u00a7441b applied to individuals, no one would believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restriction on speech.  Its purpose and effect are to silence entities whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.  See Buckley, supra, at 14\u201315 (\u201cIn a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential\u201d).  The right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-government and a necessary means to protect it.  The First Amendment \u201c\u00a0\u2018has its fullest and most urgent application\u2019 to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d  Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971)); see Buckley, supra, at 14 (\u201cDiscussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence.  Laws that burden political speech are \u201csubject to strict scrutiny,\u201d which requires the Government to prove that the restriction \u201cfurthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 464 (opinion of Roberts, C.\u00a0J.).  While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or restricted as a categorical matter, see Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment), the quoted language from WRTL provides a sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.  We shall employ it here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints.  See, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) (striking down content-based restriction).  Prohibited, too, are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.  See First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 784 (1978).  As instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:  Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content, moreover, the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers.  By taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker\u2019s voice.  The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.  The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons, but these rulings were based on an interest in allowing governmental entities to perform their functions.  See, e.g., Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 683 (1986) (protecting the \u201cfunction of public school education\u201d); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119, 129 (1977) (furthering \u201cthe legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 759 (1974) (ensuring \u201cthe capacity of the Government to discharge its [military] responsibilities\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 557 (1973) (\u201c[F]ederal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service\u201d).  The corporate independent expenditures at issue in this case, however, would not interfere with governmental functions, so these cases are inapposite.  These precedents stand only for the proposition that there are certain governmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds of speech.  By contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their votes.  At least before Austin, the Court had not allowed the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restrictions on certain disfavored speakers.  Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion.\nA\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations.  Bellotti, supra, at 778, n. 14 (citing Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85 (1977); Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U. S. 448 (1976); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922 (1975); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546 (1975); Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975); Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam); Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254; Kingsley Int\u2019l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N. Y., 360 U. S. 684 (1959); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S. 495 (1952)); see, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180 (1997); Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727 (1996); Turner, 512 U. S. 622; Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S. 105; Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989); Florida Star v. B.\u00a0J.\u00a0F., 491 U. S. 524 (1989); Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767 (1986); Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829 (1978); Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974); Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler, 398 U. S. 6 (1970).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This protection has been extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech.  See, e.g., Button, 371 U. S., at 428\u2013429; Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 244 (1936).  Under the rationale of these precedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection \u201csimply because its source is a corporation.\u201d  Bellotti, supra, at 784; see Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 8 (1986) (plurality opinion) (\u201cThe identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether speech is protected.  Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the \u2018discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas\u2019 that the First Amendment seeks to foster\u201d (quoting Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 783)).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not \u201cnatural persons.\u201d  Id., at 776; see id., at 780, n.\u00a016.  Cf. id., at 828 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At least since the latter part of the 19th century, the laws of some States and of the United States imposed a ban on corporate direct contributions to candidates.  See B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance Reform 23 (2001).  Yet not until 1947 did Congress first prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and labor unions in \u00a7304 of the Labor Management Relations Act 1947, 61 Stat. 159 (codified at 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7251 (1946 ed., Supp. I)).  In passing this Act Congress overrode the veto of President Truman, who warned that the expenditure ban was a \u201cdangerous intrusion on free speech.\u201d  Message from the President of the United States, H.\u00a0R. Doc. No. 334,  89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and union expenditures are constitutional.  See WRTL, 551 U. S., at 502 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  The question was in the background of United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106 (1948).  There, a labor union endorsed a congressional candidate in its weekly periodical.  The Court stated that \u201cthe gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the federal expenditure prohibition\u2019s] constitutionality\u201d if it were construed to suppress that writing.  Id., at 121.  The Court engaged in statutory interpretation and found the statute did not cover the publication.  Id., at 121\u2013122, and n.\u00a020.  Four Justices, however, said they would reach the constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Management Relations Act\u2019s expenditure ban.  Id., at 155 (Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ., concurring in result).  The concurrence explained that any \u201c\u00a0\u2018undue influence\u2019\u00a0\u201d generated by a speaker\u2019s \u201clarge expenditures\u201d was outweighed \u201cby the loss for democratic processes resulting from the restrictions upon free and full public discussion.\u201d  Id., at 143.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567 (1957), the Court again encountered the independent expenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7610 (1952 ed.).  See 62 Stat. 723\u2013724.  After holding only that a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates was covered by the statute, the Court \u201c[r]efus[ed] to anticipate constitutional questions\u201d and remanded for the trial to proceed.  352 U. S., at 591.  Three Justices dissented, arguing that the Court should have reached the constitutional question and that the ban on independent expenditures was unconstitutional:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUnder our Constitution it is We The People who are sovereign.  The people have the final say.  The legislators are their spokesmen.  The people determine through their votes the destiny of the nation.  It is therefore important\u2014vitally important\u2014that all channels of communications be open to them during every election, that no point of view be restrained or barred, and that the people have access to the views of every group in the community.\u201d  Id., at 593 (opinion of Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C.\u00a0J., and Black, J.).\n\nThe dissent concluded that deeming a particular group \u201ctoo powerful\u201d was not a \u201cjustificatio[n] for withholding First Amendment rights from any group\u2014labor or corporate.\u201d  Id., at 597.  The Court did not get another opportunity to consider the constitutional question in that case; for after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty.  See Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421, 463 (2008).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, in Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 400\u2013401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expenditure of union funds for political speech\u2014again without reaching the constitutional question.  The Court would not resolve that question for another four years.\n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) as amended in 1974.  These amendments created 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265, an independent expenditure ban separate from \u00a7610 that applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor unions, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, and n. 45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before addressing the constitutionality of \u00a7608(e)\u2019s independent expenditure ban, Buckley first upheld \u00a7608(b), FECA\u2019s limits on direct contributions to candidates.  The Buckley Court recognized a \u201csufficiently important\u201d governmental interest in \u201cthe prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption.\u201d  Id., at 25; see id., at 26.  This followed from the Court\u2019s concern that large contributions could be given \u201cto secure a political quid pro quo.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid pro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to candidates from independent expenditures.  The Court emphasized that \u201cthe independent expenditure ceiling \u2026 fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process,\u201d id., at 47\u201348, because \u201c[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate,\u201d id., at 47.  Buckley invalidated \u00a7608(e)\u2019s restrictions on independent expenditures, with only one Justice dissenting.  See Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 491, n.\u20023 (1985) (NCPAC).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buckley did not consider \u00a7610\u2019s separate ban on corporate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition that had also been in the background in CIO, Automobile Workers, and Pipefitters.  Had \u00a7610 been challenged in the wake of Buckley, however, it could not have been squared with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent.  See WRTL, supra, at 487 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (\u201cBuckley might well have been the last word on limitations on independent expenditures\u201d); Austin, 494 U. S., at 683 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The expenditure ban invalidated in Buckley, \u00a7608(e), applied to corporations and unions, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45; and some of the prevailing plaintiffs in Buckley were corporations, id., at 8.  The Buckley Court did not invoke the First Amendment\u2019s overbreadth doctrine, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615 (1973), to suggest that \u00a7608(e)\u2019s expenditure ban would have been constitutional if it had applied only to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., at 50.  Buckley cited with approval the Automobile Workers dissent, which argued that \u00a7610 was unconstitutional.  424 U. S., at 43 (citing 352 U. S., at 595\u2013596 (opinion of Douglas, J.)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified \u00a7610\u2019s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b four months after Buckley was decided.  See 90 Stat. 490.  Section 441b is the independent expenditure restriction challenged here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  Bellotti could not have been clearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on corporate independent expenditures related to referenda issues:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe thus find no support in the First . . . Amendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposition that speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its business or property. . . .  [That proposition] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may represent in public debate over controversial issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the subject to justify communication.\n.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIn the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue.\u201d  Id., at 784\u2013785.\n\nIt is important to note that the reasoning and holding of Bellotti did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint-discriminatory statute.  It rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to ban corporations from speaking.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the State\u2019s ban on corporate independent expenditures to support candidates.  In our view, however, that restriction would have been unconstitutional under Bellotti\u2019s central principle: that the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  See ibid.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the law stood until Austin.  Austin \u201cuph[eld] a direct restriction on the independent expenditure of funds for political speech for the first time in [this Court\u2019s] history.\u201d  494 U. S., at 695 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  There, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general treasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a specific candidate.  Michigan law, however, prohibited corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state office.  A violation of the law was punishable as a felony.  The Court sustained the speech prohibition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To bypass Buckley and Bellotti, the Austin Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion interest.  Austin found a compelling governmental interest in preventing \u201cthe corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d  494 U. S., at 660; see id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500\u2013501).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity and a post-Austin line that permits them.  No case before Austin had held that Congress could prohibit independent expenditures for political speech based on the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  Before Austin Congress had enacted legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the same proposition before this Court.  See MCFL, supra, at 257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to \u201ccurb the political influence of \u2018those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Automobile Workers, supra, at 585)); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 453 U. S. 182, 201 (1981) (Congress believed that \u201cdiffering structures and purposes\u201d of corporations and unions \u201cmay require different forms of regulation in order to protect the integrity of the electoral process\u201d).  In neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in \u00a7441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale on which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but abandons reliance upon it.  It argues instead that two other compelling interests support Austin\u2019s holding that corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an anticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (Stevens, J., concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see id., at 674\u2013675 (Brennan, J., concurring).  We consider the three points in turn.\n1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale, the Government does little to defend it.  See Tr. of  Oral Arg. 45\u201348 (Sept. 9, 2009).  And with good reason, for the rationale cannot support \u00a7441b.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.  If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on the corporate form.  The Government contends that Austin permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all forms of communication stemming from a corporation.  See Part II\u2013E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009); see also id., at 26\u201331 (Mar. 24, 2009).  If Austin were correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from expressing political views in media beyond those presented here, such as by printing books.  The Government responds \u201cthat the FEC has never applied this statute to a book,\u201d and if it did, \u201cthere would be quite [a] good as-applied challenge.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).  This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Political speech is \u201cindispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.\u201d  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see ibid. (the worth of speech \u201cdoes not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual\u201d); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48\u201349 (\u201c[T]he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment\u201d); Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); CIO, 335 U. S., at 154\u2013155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  This protection for speech is inconsistent with Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale.  Austin sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corporations from obtaining \u201c\u00a0\u2018an unfair advantage in the political marketplace\u2019\u00a0\u201d by using \u201c\u00a0\u2018resources amassed in the economic marketplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  494 U. S., at 659 (quoting MCFL, supra, at 257).  But Buckley rejected the premise that the Government has an interest \u201cin equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.\u201d  424 U. S., at 48; see Bellotti, supra, at 791, n. 30.  Buckley was specific in stating that \u201cthe skyrocketing cost of political campaigns\u201d could not sustain the governmental prohibition.  424 U. S., at 26.  The First Amendment\u2019s protections do not depend on the speaker\u2019s \u201cfinancial ability to engage in public discussion.\u201d  Id., at 49.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invalidated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain expenditures from personal funds.  See Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16) (\u201cLeveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election.  The Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress, the power to choose the Members of the House of Representatives, Art.\u00a0I, \u00a72, and it is a dangerous business for Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters\u2019 choices\u201d).  The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker\u2019s wealth is a necessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a further argument, the Austin majority undertook to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that \u201c[s]tate law grants corporations special advantages\u2014such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets.\u201d  494 U. S., at 658\u2013659.  This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech.  \u201cIt is rudimentary that the State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights.\u201d  Id., at 680 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment that corporate funds may \u201chave little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support for the corporation\u2019s political ideas.\u201d  Id., at 660 (majority opinion).  All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.  The First Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities who disagree with the speaker\u2019s ideas.  See id., at 707 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cMany persons can trace their funds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then in the form of dividends, interest, or salary\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress could ban political speech of media corporations.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (\u201cThe chilling endpoint of the Court\u2019s reasoning is not difficult to foresee: outright regulation of the press\u201d).  Cf. Tornillo, 418 U. S., at 250 (alleging the existence of \u201cvast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media empires\u201d).  Media corporations are now exempt from \u00a7441b\u2019s ban on corporate expenditures.  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i).  Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the largest media corporations have \u201cimmense aggregations of wealth,\u201d and the views expressed by media corporations often \u201chave little or no correlation to the public\u2019s support\u201d for those views.  Austin, 494 U. S., at 660.  Thus, under the Government\u2019s reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities.  There is no precedent for permitting this under the First Amendment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law now under consideration.  There is no precedent supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media corporations and those which are not.  \u201cWe have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers.\u201d  Id., at 691 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 782); see Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 784 (1985) (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., dissenting); id., at 773 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The law\u2019s exception for media corporations is, on its own terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidistortion rationale.  And the exemption results in a further, separate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, even though both have the need or the motive to communicate their views.  The exemption applies to media corporations owned or controlled by corporations that have diverse and substantial investments and participate in endeavors other than news.  So even assuming the most doubtful proposition that a news organization has a right to speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a conglomerate that owns both a media business and an unrelated business to influence or control the media in order to advance its overall business interest.  At the same time, some other corporation, with an identical business interest but no media outlet in its ownership structure, would be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the same issue.  This differential treatment cannot be squared with the First Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is simply no support for the view that the First Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the suppression of political speech by media corporations.  The Framers may not have anticipated modern business and media corporations.  See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 334, 360\u2013361 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Yet television networks and major newspapers owned by media corporations have become the most important means of mass communication in modern times.  The First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society\u2019s most salient media.  It was understood as a response to the repression of speech and the press that had existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press that were imposed in the colonies.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 252\u2013253 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Grosjean, 297 U. S., at 245\u2013248; Near, 283 U. S., at 713\u2013714.  The great debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists over our founding document were published and expressed in the most important means of mass communication of that era\u2014newspapers owned by individuals.  See McIntyre, 514 U. S., at 341\u2013343; id., at 367 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  At the founding, speech was open, comprehensive, and vital to society\u2019s definition of itself; there were no limits on the sources of speech and knowledge.  See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 5 (1967) (\u201cAny number of people could join in such proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from all sides\u201d); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic 1776\u20131787, p. 6 (1969) (\u201c[I]t is not surprising that the intellectual sources of [the Americans\u2019] Revolutionary thought were profuse and various\u201d).  The Framers may have been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of communication, but that does not mean that those speakers and media are entitled to less First Amendment protection than those types of speakers and media that provided the means of communicating political ideas when the Bill of Rights was adopted.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin interferes with the \u201copen marketplace\u201d of ideas protected by the First Amendment.  New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008); see ibid. (ideas \u201cmay compete\u201d in this marketplace \u201cwithout government interference\u201d); McConnell, supra, at 274 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  It permits the Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens.  See Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corporations filed 2006 tax returns).  Most of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth.  See Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as Amicus Curiae 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million businesses that belong to the U. S. Chamber of Commerce have fewer than 100 employees); M. Keightley, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Business Organizational Choices: Taxation and Responses to Legislative Changes 10 (2009) (more than 75% of corporations whose income is taxed under federal law, see 26 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year).  This fact belies the Government\u2019s argument that the statute is justified on the ground that it prevents the \u201cdistorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.\u201d  Austin, 494 U. S., at 660.  It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach.  The Government has \u201cmuffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.\u201d  McConnell, supra, at 257\u2013258 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  And \u201cthe electorate [has been] deprived of information, knowledge and opinion vital to its function.\u201d  CIO, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).  By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit, the Government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and advising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests.  Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the remedy of \u201cdestroying the liberty\u201d of some factions is \u201cworse than the disease.\u201d  The Federalist No. 10, p. 130 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  Factions should be checked by permitting them all to speak, see ibid., and by entrusting the people to judge what is true and what is false.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations, from presenting both facts and opinions to the public.  This makes Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale all the more an aberration.  \u201c[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and administrative bodies.\u201d  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 31 (citing California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 510\u2013511 (1972); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 137\u2013138 (1961)).  Corporate executives and employees counsel Members of Congress and Presidential administrations on many issues, as a matter of routine and often in private.  An amici brief filed on behalf of Montana and 25 other States notes that lobbying and corporate communications with elected officials occur on a regular basis.  Brief for State of Montana et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19.  When that phenomenon is coupled with \u00a7441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit corporations cannot raise a voice to object when other corporations, including those with vast wealth, are cooperating with the Government.  That cooperation may sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a Government official who uses his or her authority, influence, and power to threaten corporations to support the Government\u2019s policies.  Those kinds of interactions are often unknown and unseen.  The speech that \u00a7441b forbids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and purpose.  References to massive corporate treasuries should not mask the real operation of this law.  Rhetoric ought not obscure reality.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if \u00a7441b\u2019s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so.  And wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures.  See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S., at 503\u2013504 (opinion of Scalia,\u00a0J.) (\u201cIn the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142 million to [26 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7527 organizations]\u201d).  Yet certain disfavored associations of citizens\u2014those that have taken on the corporate form\u2014are penalized for engaging in the same political speech.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought.  This is unlawful.  The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.    \n2\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government.  For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.  In Buckley, the Court found this interest \u201csufficiently important\u201d to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that reasoning to expenditure limits.  424 U. S., at 25.  When Buckley examined an expenditure ban, it found \u201cthat the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inadequate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.\u201d  Id., at 45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to large direct contributions, Buckley reasoned that they could be given \u201cto secure a political quid pro quo,\u201d id., at 26, and that \u201cthe scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained,\u201d id., at 27.  The practices Buckley noted would be covered by bribery laws, see, e.g., 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201, if a quid pro quo arrangement were proved.  See Buckley, supra, at 27, and n. 28 (citing Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.\u00a02d 821, 839\u2013840, and nn. 36\u201338 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam)).  The Court, in consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contributions are preventative, because few if any contributions to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.  MCFL, 479 U. S., at 260; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500; Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 210 (1982) (NRWC).  The Buckley Court, nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in order to ensure against the reality or appearance of corruption.  That case did not extend this rationale to independent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.\u201d  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (independent expenditures have a \u201csubstantially diminished potential for abuse\u201d).  Limits on independent expenditures, such as \u00a7441b, have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government\u2019s interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.  The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question.  Indeed, 26 States do not restrict independent expenditures by for-profit corporations.  The Government does not claim that these expenditures have corrupted the political process in those States.  See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n.\u00a03; Supp. Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America as Amicus Curiae 8\u20139, n.\u00a05.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single footnote in Bellotti purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures could be shown to cause corruption.  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.  For the reasons explained above, we now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  Dicta in Bellotti\u2019s footnote suggested that \u201ca corporation\u2019s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.\u201d  Ibid.  Citing the portion of Buckley that invalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424 U. S., at 46, and a law review student comment, Bellotti surmised that \u201cCongress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.\u201d  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.  Buckley, however, struck down a ban on independent expenditures to support candidates that covered corporations, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that \u201cthe distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application,\u201d id., at 42.  Bellotti\u2019s dictum is thus supported only by a law review student comment, which misinterpreted Buckley.  See Comment, The Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and Minority Rights and Remedies, 126 U.\u00a0Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 386, 408 (1977) (suggesting that \u201ccorporations and labor unions should be held to different and more stringent standards than an individual or other associations under a regulatory scheme for campaign financing\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seizing on this aside in Bellotti\u2019s footnote, the Court in NRWC did say there is a \u201csufficient\u201d governmental interest in \u201censur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth amassed\u201d by corporations would not \u201cbe used to incur political debts from legislators who are aided by the contributions.\u201d  459 U. S., at 207\u2013208 (citing Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 579); see 459 U. S., at 210, and n.\u00a07; NCPAC, supra, at 500\u2013501 (NRWC suggested a governmental interest in restricting \u201cthe influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form\u201d).  NRWC, however, has little relevance here.  NRWC decided no more than that a restriction on a corporation\u2019s ability to solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct contributions to candidates, did not violate the First Amendment.  459 U. S., at 206.  NRWC thus involved contribution limits, see NCPAC, supra, at 495\u2013496, which, unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an accepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption, see McConnell, 540 U. S., at 136\u2013138, and n. 40; MCFL, supra, at 259\u2013260.  Citizens United has not made direct contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.  See McConnell, supra, at 296\u2013298 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (citing Buckley, supra, at 26\u201328, 30, 46\u201348); NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497 (\u201cThe hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political favors\u201d); id., at 498.  The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt:\n\u201cFavoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics.  It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support those policies.  It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason, if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing those political outcomes the supporter favors.  Democracy is premised on responsiveness.\u201d  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 297 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\n\nReliance on a \u201cgeneric favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First Amendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.\u201d  Id., at 296.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.  By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.  See Buckley, supra, at 46.  The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.  This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse \u201c\u00a0\u2018to take part in democratic governance\u2019\u00a0\u201d because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker.  McConnell, supra, at 144 (quoting Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 390 (2000)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___ (2009), is not to the contrary.  Caperton held that a judge was required to recuse himself \u201cwhen a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds or directing the judge\u2019s election campaign when the case was pending or imminent.\u201d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge.  See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975).  Caperton\u2019s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused, not that the litigant\u2019s political speech could be banned.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The McConnell record was \u201cover 100,000 pages\u201d long, McConnell I, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 209, yet it \u201cdoes not have any direct examples of votes being exchanged for . . . expenditures,\u201d id., at 560 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  This confirms Buckley\u2019s reasoning that independent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption.  In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate.  See 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 555\u2013557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.  The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to political parties, called \u201csoft money,\u201d were made to gain access to elected officials.  McConnell, supra, at 125, 130\u2013131, 146\u2013152; see McConnell I, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 471\u2013481, 491\u2013506 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.); id., at 842\u2013843, 858\u2013859 (opinion of Leon, J.).  This case, however, is about independent expenditures, not soft money.  When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an unconstitutional remedy.  If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern.  We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences.  The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule.  An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.  Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption.\n3\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government contends further that corporate independent expenditures can be limited because of its interest in protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate political speech.  This asserted interest, like Austin\u2019s antidistortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban the political speech even of media corporations.  See supra, at 35\u201337.  Assume, for example, that a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper disagrees with the political views the newspaper expresses.  See Austin, 494 U. S., at 687 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Under the Government\u2019s view, that potential disagreement could give the Government the authority to restrict the media corporation\u2019s political speech.  The First Amendment does not allow that power.  There is, furthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders \u201cthrough the procedures of corporate democracy.\u201d  Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 794; see id., at 794, n. 34.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder-protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both underinclusive and overinclusive.  As to the first, if Congress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders, it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain media within 30 or 60 days before an election.  A dissenting shareholder\u2019s interests would be implicated by speech in any media at any time.  As to the second, the statute is overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with only single shareholders.  As to other corporations, the remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and explore other regulatory mechanisms.  The regulatory mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First Amendment.\n4\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling interest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation\u2019s political process.  Cf. 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441e (contribution and expenditure ban applied to \u201cforeign national[s]\u201d).  Section 441b is not limited to corporations or associations that were created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign shareholders.  Section 441b therefore would be overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Government has a compelling interest in limiting foreign influence over our political process.  See Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 615.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts us on a course that is sure error.  \u201cBeyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.\u201d  Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13) (overruling Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)).  We have also examined whether \u201cexperience has pointed up the precedent\u2019s shortcomings.\u201d  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (overruling Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court\u2019s earlier precedents in Buckley and Bellotti.  \u201cThis Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the First Amendment.\u201d  WRTL, 551 U. S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  \u201c[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\u201d  Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons above, it must be concluded that Austin was not well reasoned.  The Government defends Austin, relying almost entirely on \u201cthe quid pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the shareholder interest,\u201d and not Austin\u2019s expressed antidistortion rationale.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see id., at 45\u201346.  When neither party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of adhering to that precedent through stare decisis is diminished.  Austin abandoned First Amendment principles, furthermore, by relying on language in some of our precedents that traces back to the Automobile Workers Court\u2019s flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as Amici Curiae; Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns, Congress, and Courts 33\u201335, 153\u2013157 (1988).  See Austin, supra, at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257\u2013258; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500\u2013501); MCFL, supra, at 257 (quoting Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 585); NCPAC, supra, at 500 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210); id., at 208 (\u201cThe history of the movement to regulate the political contributions and expenditures of corporations and labor unions is set forth in great detail in [Automobile Workers], supra, at 570\u2013584, and we need only summarize the development here\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin is undermined by experience since its announcement.  Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws.  See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 176\u2013177 (\u201cGiven BCRA\u2019s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7527] organizations will only increase\u201d).  Our Nation\u2019s speech dynamic is changing, and informative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights.  Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle.  Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views.  On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of\nall sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rapid changes in technology\u2014and the creative dynamic inherent in the concept of free expression\u2014counsel against upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers.  See Part II\u2013C, supra.  Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective way to convey a political message.  See McConnell, supra, at 261 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Soon, however, it may be that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking Web sites, will provide citizens with significant information about political candidates and issues.  Yet, \u00a7441b would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created with corporate funds.  See 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b(a); MCFL, supra, at 249.  The First Amendment does not permit Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of the political speech.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No serious reliance interests are at stake.  As the Court stated in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991), reliance interests are important considerations in property and contract cases, where parties may have acted in conformance with existing legal rules in order to conduct transactions.  Here, though, parties have been prevented from acting\u2014corporations have been banned from making independent expenditures.  Legislatures may have enacted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those bans were constitutional.  This is not a compelling interest for stare decisis.  If it were, legislative acts could prevent us from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfering with our duty \u201cto say what the law is.\u201d  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin, 494 U. S. 652, should be and now is overruled.  We return to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker\u2019s corporate identity.  No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.\nD\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to limit corporate independent expenditures.  As the Government appears to concede, overruling Austin \u201ceffectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section 203, but also 2 U. S.\u00a0C. 441b\u2019s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express advocacy.\u201d  Brief for Appellee 33, n.\u00a012.  Section 441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures are therefore invalid and cannot be applied to Hillary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA \u00a7203\u2019s extension of \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures.  See 540 U. S., at 203\u2013209.  The McConnell Court relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in Austin to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld in Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have found this interest unconvincing and insufficient.  This part of McConnell is now overruled.\nIV\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United next challenges BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three advertisements for the movie.  Under BCRA \u00a7311, televised electioneering communications funded by anyone other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that \u201c\u00a0\u2018_______ is responsible for the content of this advertising.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  2 U. S. C. \u00a7441d(d)(2).  The required statement must be made in a \u201cclearly spoken manner,\u201d and displayed on the screen in a \u201cclearly readable manner\u201d for at least four seconds.  Ibid.  It must state that the communication \u201cis not authorized by any candidate or candidate\u2019s committee\u201d; it must also display the name and address (or Web site address) of the person or group that funded the advertisement.  \u00a7441d(a)(3).  Under BCRA \u00a7201, any person who spends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year must file a disclosure statement with the FEC.  2 U. S. C. \u00a7434(f)(1).  That statement must identify the person making the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the communication was directed, and the names of certain contributors.  \u00a7434(f)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they \u201cimpose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\u201d Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, and \u201cdo not prevent anyone from speaking,\u201d McConnell, supra, at 201 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  The Court has subjected these requirements to \u201cexacting scrutiny,\u201d which requires a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between the disclosure requirement and a \u201csufficiently important\u201d governmental interest.  Buckley, supra, at 64, 66 (internal quotation marks omitted); see McConnell, supra, at 231\u2013232.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Buckley, the Court explained that disclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in \u201cprovid[ing] the electorate with information\u201d about the sources of election-related spending.  424 U. S., at 66.  The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial challenges to BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.  540 U. S., at 196.  There was evidence in the record that independent groups were running election-related advertisements \u201c\u00a0\u2018while hiding behind dubious and misleading names.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 197 (quoting McConnell I, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 237).  The Court therefore upheld BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 on the ground that they would help citizens \u201c\u00a0\u2018make informed choices in the political marketplace.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  540 U. S., at 197 (quoting McConnell I, supra,  at 237); see 540 U. S.,  at 231.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although both provisions were facially upheld, the Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a group could show a \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasonable probability\u2019\u00a0\u201d that disclosure of its contributors\u2019 names \u201c\u00a0\u2018will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 198 (quoting Buckley, supra, at 74).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and two 10-second ads to promote Hillary.  Under FEC regulations, a communication that \u201c[p]roposes a commercial transaction\u201d was not subject to 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate or union funding of electioneering communications.  11 CFR \u00a7114.15(b)(3)(ii).  The regulations, however, do not exempt those communications from the disclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311.  See 72 Fed. Reg. 72901 (2007).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United argues that the disclaimer requirements in \u00a7311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads.  It contends that the governmental interest in providing information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including the ones at issue here.  We disagree.  The ads fall within BCRA\u2019s definition of an \u201celectioneering communication\u201d: They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references to her candidacy.  See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2\u20134.  The disclaimers required by \u00a7311 \u201cprovid[e] the electorate with information,\u201d McConnell, supra, at 196, and \u201cinsure that the voters are fully informed\u201d about the person or group who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76; see also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 32 (\u201cIdentification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected\u201d).  At the very least, the disclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not funded by a candidate or political party.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United argues that \u00a7311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising.  It asserts that \u00a7311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of the group\u2019s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer.  We rejected these arguments in McConnell, supra, at 230\u2013231.  And we now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclosure provisions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any event, the disclosure requirements in \u00a7201 must be confined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The principal opinion in WRTL limited 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on independent expenditures to express advocacy and its functional equivalent.  551 U. S., at 469\u2013476 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.).  Citizens United seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA\u2019s disclosure requirements.  We reject this contention.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech.  See, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 262.  In Buckley, the Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent expenditures even though it invalidated a provision that imposed a ceiling on those expenditures.  424 U. S., at 75\u201376.  In McConnell, three Justices who would have found \u00a7441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold BCRA\u2019s disclosure and disclaimer requirements.  540 U. S., at 321 (opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., and Scalia, J.).  And the Court has upheld registration and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even though Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself.  United States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612, 625 (1954) (Congress \u201chas merely provided for a modicum of information from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose\u201d).  For these reasons, we reject Citizens United\u2019s contention that the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citizens United also disputes that an informational interest justifies the application of \u00a7201 to its ads, which only attempt to persuade viewers to see the film.  Even if it disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens United says, the information would not help viewers make informed choices in the political marketplace.  This is similar to the argument rejected above with respect to disclaimers.  Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.  Because the informational interest alone is sufficient to justify application of \u00a7201 to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government\u2019s other asserted interests.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure requirements can chill donations to an organization by exposing donors to retaliation.  Some amici point to recent events in which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threatened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation.  See Brief for Institute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 13\u201316; Brief for Alliance Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 16\u201322.  In McConnell, the Court recognized that \u00a7201 would be unconstitutional as applied to an organization if there were a reasonable probability that the group\u2019s members would face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were disclosed.  540 U. S., at 198.  The examples cited by amici are cause for concern.  Citizens United, however, has offered no evidence that its members may face similar threats or reprisals.  To the contrary, Citizens United has been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no instance of harassment or retaliation.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of corporate democracy, see Bellotti, supra, at 794, and n. 34, can be more effective today because modern technology makes disclosures rapid and informative.  A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today.  It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Congress\u2019 findings in passing BCRA were premised on a system without adequate disclosure.  See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 128 (\u201c[T]he public may not have been fully informed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads\u201d); id., at 196\u2013197 (quoting McConnell I, 251 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 237).  With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.  Shareholders can determine whether their corporation\u2019s political speech advances the corporation\u2019s interest in making profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are \u201c\u00a0\u2018in the pocket\u2019 of so-called moneyed interests.\u201d  540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see MCFL, supra, at 261.  The First Amendment protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way.  This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the same reasons we uphold the application of BCRA \u00a7\u00a7201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their application to Hillary.  We find no constitutional impediment to the application of BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure requirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand.  And there has been no showing that, as applied in this case, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or expression.\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington reached the circles of Government, some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its distribution.  See Smoodin, \u201cCompulsory\u201d Viewing for Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, Capra\u2019s Capitol Offense, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5.  Under Austin, though, officials could have done more than discourage its distribution\u2014they could have banned the film.  After all, it, like Hillary, was speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress.  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on Youtube.com might portray public officials or public policies in unflattering ways.  Yet if a covered transmission during the blackout period creates the background for candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media corporation, has made the \u201cpurchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value\u201d in order to engage in political speech.  2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7431(9)(A)(i).  Speech would be suppressed in the realm where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue preceding a real election.  Governments are often hostile to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems stranger than fiction for our Government to make this political speech a crime.  Yet this is the statute\u2019s purpose and design.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some members of the public might consider Hillary to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation\u2019s course; still others simply might suspend judgment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates.  Those choices and assessments, however, are not for the Government to make.  \u201cThe First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create in the realm of thought and speech.  Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of ideas.  The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\u201d  McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7441b\u2019s restrictions on corporate independent expenditures.  The judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA\u2019s disclaimer and disclosure requirements.

They sued the responsible parties for recovery. A federal district court held the responsible parties (Burlington Northern Rail Road, Santa Fe Railway Company, and Shell Oil Company) liable for only a minor portion of the cleanup costs. The EPA and DTSC jointly appealed.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred in its liability calculations. It reasoned that the recovery statute employed by the EPA and DTSC imposed strict liability on parties merely partly responsible for contamination. It explained that the statute's intention was to prevent taxpayers from bearing the burden of such cleanup costs.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Is Shell Oil Company liable for \"arranging\" the disposal of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) when it merely sold and shipped a product that only caused contamination while under the control and ownership of the purchaser?</p>\n<p>2) Did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit err by reversing the district court's liability calculations under CERCLA?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No and Yes. The Supreme Court held that Shell was not liable as an \"arranger\" for the contamination at issue in this case. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that Shell did not \"intend\" that at least a portion of its product be disposed by proscribed methods and thus was not an \"arranger.\" The Court also held that the Ninth Circuit erred by reversing the district court's CERCLA liability calculations. Rather, it reasoned that the district court reasonably apportioned Burlington Railroad's share of liability at the contaminated site in question.</p>\n<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. She argued that Shell should qualify as an \"arranger\" because it \"arranged for disposal\u2026 of hazardous substances\" at the contaminated site. She also argued that the case should be remanded such that all liable parties could provide input as to the proper liability apportionment formula.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 33975, "name": "Kathleen M.

See 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79607(a)(3).  As the facts found by the District Court bear out, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, pp. 113a\u2013129a, 208a\u2013213a, Shell \u201carranged for disposal \u2026 of hazardous substances\u201d owned by Shell when the arrangements were made.[Footnote 1]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s, Shell shipped most of its products to Brown and Bryant (B&B) in 55-gallon drums, thereby ensuring against spillage or leakage during delivery and transfer.  Id., at 89a, 115a.  Later, Shell found it economically advantageous, in lieu of shipping in drums, to require B&B to maintain bulk storage facilities for receipt of the chemicals B&B purchased from Shell.  Id., at 115a.  By the mid-1960\u2019s, Shell was delivering its chemical to B&B in bulk tank truckloads.  Id., at 89a, 115a.  As the Court recognizes, \u201cbulk storage of the chemical led to numerous tank failures and spills as the chemical rusted tanks and eroded valves.\u201d  Ante, at 2\u20133, n.\u00a01.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shell furthermore specified the equipment to be used in transferring the chemicals from the delivery truck to B&B\u2019s storage tanks.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, pp. 120a\u2013122a, 124a.[Footnote 2]  In the process, spills and leaks were inevitable, indeed spills occurred every time deliveries were made.  520 F.\u00a03d 918, 950\u2013951 (CA9 2008).  See also App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, pp. 119a\u2013122a (\u201cIt is undisputed that spills were inherent in the delivery process that Shell arranged \u2026\u00a0.\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Shell sold B&B useful products, the Ninth Circuit observed, did not exonerate Shell from CERCLA liability, for the sales \u201cnecessarily and immediately result[ed] in the leakage of hazardous substances.\u201d  520 F.\u00a03d, at 950.  The deliveries, Shell was well aware, directly and routinely resulted in disposals of hazardous substances (through spills and leaks) for more than 20 years.  \u201c[M]ere knowledge\u201d may not be enough, ante, at 13, but Shell did not simply know of the spills and leaks without contributing to them.  Given the control rein held by Shell over the mode of delivery and transfer, 520 F.\u00a03d, at 950\u2013951, the lower courts held and I agree, Shell was properly ranked an arranger.  Relieving Shell of any obligation to pay for the cleanup undertaken by the United States and California is hardly commanded by CERCLA\u2019s text, and is surely at odds with CERCLA\u2019s objective\u2014to place the cost of remediation on persons whose activities contributed to the contamination rather than on the taxpaying public.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to apportioning costs, the District Court undertook an heroic labor.  The Railroads and Shell, the court noted, had pursued a \u201c\u00a0\u2018scorched earth,\u2019 all-or-nothing approach to liability.  Neither acknowledged an iota of responsibility \u2026\u00a0. Neither party offered helpful arguments to apportion liability.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, p. 236a, \u00b6455.  Consequently, the court strived \u201cindependently [to] perform [an] equitable apportionment analysis.\u201d  Id., at 237a, \u00b6455.  Given the party presentation principle basic to our procedural system, Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5), it is questionable whether the court should have pursued the matter sua sponte.  See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cOur adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d).  Cf. Kaplan, von Mehren, & Schaefer, Phases of German Civil Procedure I, 71 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1193, 1224 (1958) (describing court\u2019s obligation, under Germany\u2019s Code of Civil Procedure, to see to it that the case is fully developed).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court\u2019s mode of procedure, the United States urged before this Court, \u201cdeprived the government of a fair opportunity to respond to the court\u2019s theories of apportionment and to rebut their factual underpinnings\u2014an opportunity the governmen[t] would have had if those theories had been advanced by petitioners themselves.\u201d  Brief for United States 41.[Footnote 3]  I would return these cases to the District Court to give all parties a fair opportunity to address that court\u2019s endeavor to allocate costs.  Because the Court\u2019s disposition precludes that opportunity, I dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment.  \n\u00a0\u201cDisposal\u201d is defined in 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a76903(3) to include \u201cspilling [or] leaking\u201d of \u201cany \u2026 hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that [the] \u2026 hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters.\u201d\n\u00a0Shell shipped the chemicals to B&B \u201cF.O.B. Destination.\u201d  At oral argument, the Court asked Shell\u2019s counsel: Suppose there had been \u201cno transfer of ownership until the delivery [was] complete?\u201d  In that event, counsel responded, \u201cShell would have been the owner of the waste.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  The Court credits the fact that at the time of the spills, the chemicals, having been shipped \u201cF.O.B. Destination,\u201d \u201chad come under B&B\u2019s stewardship.\u201d  Ante, at 12.  In my view, CERCLA liability, or the absence thereof, should not turn, in any part, on such an eminently shipper-fixable specification as \u201cF.O.B. Destination.\u201d\n\u00a0For example, on brief, the United States observed: \u201c[P]etitioners identify no record support for the district court\u2019s assumption that each party\u2019s contribution to the overall harm is proportional to the relative volume of hazardous substances attributable to it.\u201d  Brief for United States 45.  And at oral argument, counsel for the United States stressed that the District Court \u201cframed the relevant inquiry as what percentage of the contamination was attributable to the railroad parcel, to the Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel.  But it made no finding \u2026 as to what the cost of [remediation] would have been \u2026 if the only source of contamination had been the railroad parcel.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  See also id., at 56 (\u201c[T]he crucial question is what response costs the government would have been required to bear \u2026 if only the railroad parcel\u2019s contamination had been at issue \u2026\u00a0.\u201d)."}, {"id": 1771, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962905, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/599/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1771", "justia_text": "BURLINGTON NORTHERN & SANTA\u00a0FE RAILWAY CO. et\u00a0al. v. UNITED STATES et\u00a0al.\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\nNo. 07\u20131601.\u2003Argued February 24, 2009\u2014Decided May 4, 2009\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those responsible for the contamination.  In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc. (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a parcel of land located in Arvin, California.  B&B later expanded onto an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company (Railroads).  As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored various hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D\u2013D, which it bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell).  Over time, many of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a result of equipment failures.    \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamination and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA authority to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action against Shell and the Railroads.  The District Court ruled in favor of the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially responsible parties under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads because they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had \u201carranged for disposal \u2026 of hazardous substances,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79607(a)(3), through D\u2013D\u2019s sale and delivery.  The District Court apportioned liability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments\u2019 total response costs, and Shell liable for 6%.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under \u00a79607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision in that respect.  Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Governments\u2019 response costs.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the Arvin facility.  Section \u00a79607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond the limits of the statute itself.  Because CERCLA does not specifically define what it means to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal of a hazardous substance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning.  In common parlance, \u201carrange\u201d implies action directed to a specific purpose.  Thus, under \u00a79607(a)(3)\u2019s plain language, an entity may qualify as an arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.  To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into D\u2013D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of \u00a76903(3)\u2019s methods.  The facts found by the District Court do not support such a conclusion.  The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during D\u2013D\u2019s transfer from the common carrier to B&B\u2019s storage tanks after the product had come under B&B\u2019s stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills.  Thus, Shell\u2019s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient grounds for concluding that it \u201carranged for\u201d D\u2013D\u2019s disposal.  Pp.\u00a08\u201313.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\u2019 share of the site remediation costs at 9%.  Calculating liability based on three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B\u2019s business divided by the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease, and the court\u2019s determination that only two polluting chemicals (not D\u2013D) spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination\u2014the District Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for 9% of the remediation costs.  The District Court\u2019s detailed findings show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the facility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous-chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, some of which did not require remediation.  Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring remediation.

The Act was designed to promote the \u201c\u00a0\u2018timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites\u2019\u00a0\u201d and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.  Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\u00a0Y. v. UGI Util., Inc., 423 F. 3d 90, 94 (CA2 2005); see also Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc., 516 U. S. 479, 483 (1996); Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 805 F. 2d 1074, 1081 (CA1 1986).  These cases raise the questions whether and to what extent a party associated with a contaminated site may be held responsible for the full costs of remediation.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc. (B&B), began operating an agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing pesticides and other chemical products from suppliers such as Shell Oil Company (Shell).  Using its own equipment, B&B applied its products to customers\u2019 farms.  B&B opened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farmland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded operations onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now known respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company) (Railroads).  Both parcels of the Arvin facility were graded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the southeast corner of the primary parcel.  See Appendix, infra.  Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined until 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from the facility to seep into the ground water below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During its years of operation, B&B stored and distributed various hazardous chemicals on its property.  Among these were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals, and the pesticides D\u2013D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.  Dinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon containers on a concrete slab outside B&B\u2019s warehouse.  Nemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon containers inside the warehouse.  Originally, B&B purchased D\u2013D in 55-gallon drums; beginning in the mid-1960\u2019s, however, Shell began requiring its distributors to maintain bulk storage facilities for D\u2013D.  From that time onward, B&B purchased D\u2013D in bulk.[Footnote 1] \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When B&B purchased D\u2013D, Shell would arrange for delivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.[Footnote 2]  When the product arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a bulk storage tank located on B&B\u2019s primary parcel.  From there, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks, nurse tanks, and pull rigs.  During each of these transfers leaks and spills could\u2014and often did\u2014occur.  Although the common carrier and B&B used buckets to catch spills from hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its bulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or were knocked over, causing D\u2013D to spill onto the ground during the transfer process.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aware that spills of D\u2013D were commonplace among its distributors, in the late 1970\u2019s Shell took several steps to encourage the safe handling of its products.  Shell provided distributors with detailed safety manuals and instituted a voluntary discount program for distributors that made improvements in their bulk handling and safety facilities.  Later, Shell revised its program to require distributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer and provide self-certification of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  B&B\u2019s Arvin facility was inspected twice, and in 1981, B&B certified to Shell that it had made a number of recommended improvements to its facilities.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite these improvements, B&B remained a \u201c\u00a0\u2018[s]loppy\u2019 [o]perator.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, p. 130a.  Over the course of B&B\u2019s 28 years of operation, delivery spills, equipment failures, and the rinsing of tanks and trucks allowed Nemagon, D\u2013D and dinoseb to seep into the soil and upper levels of ground water of the Arvin facility.  In 1983, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&B\u2019s violation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed suit, discovering significant contamination of soil and ground water.  Of particular concern was a plume of contaminated ground water located under the facility that threatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential drinking water.[Footnote 3]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although B&B undertook some efforts at remediation, by 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.  That same year, the Arvin facility was added to the National Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subsequently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their authority under 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79604 to undertake cleanup efforts at the site.  By 1998, the Governments had spent more than $8 million responding to the site contamination; their costs have continued to accrue.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the Railroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the property on which the Arvin facility was located, to perform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.  The Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3 million in the process.  Seeking to recover at least a portion of their response costs, in 1992 the Railroads brought suit against B&B in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.  In 1996, that lawsuit was consolidated with two recovery actions brought by DTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in 1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of the Governments.  In a lengthy order supported by 507 separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court held that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially responsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads because they were owners of a portion of the facility, see 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1)\u2013(2), and Shell because it had \u201carranged for\u201d the disposal of hazardous substances through its sale and delivery of D\u2013D, see \u00a79607(a)(3).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the court found the parties liable, it did not impose joint and several liability on Shell and the Railroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Governments.  The court found that the site contamination created a single harm but concluded that the harm was divisible and therefore capable of apportionment.  Based on three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the facility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B\u2019s business divided by the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease, and the Court\u2019s determination that only two of three polluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required remediation and that those two chemicals were responsible for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination requiring remediation\u2014the court apportioned the Railroads\u2019 liability as 9% of the Governments\u2019 total response cost.[Footnote 4]  Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell products, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site response cost.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Governments appealed the District Court\u2019s apportionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court\u2019s finding of liability.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell did not qualify as a \u201ctraditional\u201d arranger under \u00a79607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&B to directly dispose of a hazardous waste product.  520 F.\u00a03d 918, 948 (CA9 2008).  Nevertheless, the court stated that Shell could still be held liable under a \u201c\u00a0\u2018broader\u2019 category of arranger liability\u201d if the \u201cdisposal of hazardous wastes [wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of, the transaction giving rise to\u201d arranger liability.  Ibid.  Relying on CERCLA\u2019s definition of \u201cdisposal,\u201d which covers acts such as \u201cleaking\u201d and \u201cspilling,\u201d 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a76903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could arrange for \u201cdisposal\u201d \u201ceven if it did not intend to dispose\u201d of a hazardous substance.  520 F.\u00a03d, at 949.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance through its sale and delivery of D\u2013D:\n\u201cShell arranged for delivery of the substances to the site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and provided advice and supervision concerning safe transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous substance was thus a necessary part of the sale and delivery process.\u201d  Id., at 950.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger liability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of Shell\u2019s action had been to transport a useful and previously unused product to B&B for sale.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals found \u201cno dispute\u201d on the question whether the harm caused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of apportionment.  Id., at 942.  The court observed that a portion of the site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel became part of the facility, only some of the hazardous substances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and \u201conly some of the water on the facility washed over the Railroads\u2019 site.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to Shell, the court noted that not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the facility had been sold by Shell.  Given those facts, the court readily concluded that \u201cthe contamination traceable to the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information, would be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that contamination.\u201d  Ibid.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in finding that the record established a reasonable basis for apportionment.  Because the burden of proof on the question of apportionment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s apportionment of liability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Governments\u2019 cost of responding to the contamination of the Arvin facility.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc, which the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of eight judges.  See id., at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting).  We granted certiorari to determine whether Shell was properly held liable as an entity that had \u201carranged for disposal\u201d of hazardous substances within the meaning of \u00a79607(a)(3), and whether Shell and the Railroads were properly held liable for all response costs incurred by EPA and the State of California.  See 554 U. S. ___ (2008).  Finding error on both points, we now reverse.\nII\n\nCERCLA imposes strict liability for environmental contamination upon four broad classes of PRPs:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(1)\u2002the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility, \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(2)\u2002any person[[Footnote 5]] who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(3)\u2002any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(4)\u2002any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance\u2026\u00a0.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79607(a).\n\nOnce an entity is identified as a PRP, it may be compelled to clean up a contaminated area or reimburse the Government for its past and future response costs.  See Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161 (2004).[Footnote 6]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these cases, it is undisputed that the Railroads qualify as PRPs under both \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1) and 9607(a)(2) because they owned the land leased by B&B at the time of the contamination and continue to own it now.  The more difficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP under \u00a79607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances surrounding its sales to B&B.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an arranger, we begin with the language of the statute.  As relevant here, \u00a79607(a)(3) applies to an entity that \u201carrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.\u201d  It is plain from the language of the statute that CERCLA liability would attach under \u00a79607(a)(3) if an entity were to enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discarding a used and no longer useful hazardous substance.  It is similarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an arranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the purchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the seller, disposed of the product in a way that led to contamination.  See Freeman v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 189 F.\u00a03d 160, 164 (CA2 1999); Florida Power & Light Co. v. Allis Chalmers Corp., 893 F. 2d 1313, 1318 (CA11 1990).  Less clear is the liability attaching to the many permutations of \u201carrangements\u201d that fall between these two extremes\u2014cases in which the seller has some knowledge of the buyers\u2019 planned disposal or whose motives for the \u201csale\u201d of a hazardous substance are less than clear.  In such cases, courts have concluded that the determination whether an entity is an arranger requires a fact-intensive inquiry that looks beyond the parties\u2019 characterization of the transaction as a \u201cdisposal\u201d or a \u201csale\u201d and seeks to discern whether the arrangement was one Congress intended to fall within the scope of CERCLA\u2019s strict-liability provisions.  See Freeman, 189 F.\u00a03d, at 164; Pneumo Abex Corp. v. High Point, Thomasville & Denton R. Co., 142 F. 3d 769, 775 (CA4 1998) (\u201c\u00a0\u2018[T]here is no bright line between a sale and a disposal under CERCLA.  A party\u2019s responsibility \u2026 must by necessity turn on a fact-specific inquiry into the nature of the transaction\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting United States v. Petersen Sand & Gravel, 806 F. Supp. 1346, 1354 (ND Ill. 1992))); Florida Power & Light Co., 893 F. 2d, at 1318.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although we agree that the question whether \u00a79607(a)(3) liability attaches is fact intensive and case specific, such liability may not extend beyond the limits of the statute itself.  Because CERCLA does not specifically define what it means to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal of a hazardous substance, see, e.g., United States v. Cello-Foil Prods., Inc., 100 F.\u00a03d 1227, 1231 (CA6 1996); Amcast Indus. Corp. v. Detrex Corp., 2 F.\u00a03d 746, 751 (CA7 1993); Florida Power & Light Co., 893 F. 2d, at 1317, we give the phrase its ordinary meaning.  Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson Cty., 555 U. S. ____ (2009); Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979).  In common parlance, the word \u201carrange\u201d implies action directed to a specific purpose.  See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 64 (10th ed. 1993) (defining \u201carrange\u201d as \u201cto make preparations for: plan[;] . . . to bring about an agreement or understanding concerning\u201d); see also Amcast Indus. Corp., 2 F. 3d, at 751 (words \u201c\u00a0\u2018arranged for\u2019 . . . imply intentional action\u201d).  Consequently, under the plain language of the statute, an entity may qualify as an arranger under \u00a79607(a)(3) when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.  See Cello-Foil Prods., Inc., 100 F.\u00a03d, at 1231 (\u201c[I]t would be error for us not to recognize the indispensable role that state of mind must play in determining whether a party has \u2018otherwise arranged for disposal \u2026 of hazardous substances\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Governments do not deny that the statute requires an entity to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal; however, they interpret that phrase by reference to the statutory term \u201cdisposal,\u201d which the Act broadly defines as \u201cthe discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a76903(3); see also \u00a79601(29) (adopting the definition of \u201cdisposal\u201d contained in the Solid Waste Disposal Act).[Footnote 7]  The Governments assert that by including unintentional acts such as \u201cspilling\u201d and \u201cleaking\u201d in the definition of disposal, Congress intended to impose liability on entities not only when they directly dispose of waste products but also when they engage in legitimate sales of hazardous substances[Footnote 8] knowing that some disposal may occur as a collateral consequence of the sale itself.  Applying that reading of the statute, the Governments contend that Shell arranged for the disposal of D\u2013D within the meaning of \u00a79607(a)(3) by shipping D\u2013D to B&B under conditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion of the hazardous substance by the purchaser or common carrier.  See Brief for United States 24 (\u201cAlthough the delivery of a useful product was the ultimate purpose of the arrangement, Shell\u2019s continued participation in the delivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would result, was sufficient to establish Shell\u2019s intent to dispose of hazardous substances\u201d).  Because these spills resulted in wasted D\u2013D, a result Shell anticipated, the Governments insist that Shell was properly found to have arranged for the disposal of D\u2013D.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While it is true that in some instances an entity\u2019s knowledge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or otherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity\u2019s intent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone is insufficient to prove that an entity \u201cplanned for\u201d the disposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a peripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful product.  In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into the sale of D\u2013D with the intention that at least a portion of the product be disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of the methods described in \u00a76903(3).  Here, the facts found by the District Court do not support such a conclusion.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that Shell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred during the transfer of D\u2013D from the common carrier to B&B\u2019s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at the Arvin facility and had come under B&B\u2019s stewardship, the evidence does not support an inference that Shell intended such spills to occur.  To the contrary, the evidence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of such spills, providing them with detailed safety manuals, requiring them to maintain adequate storage facilities, and providing discounts for those that took safety precautions.  Although Shell\u2019s efforts were less than wholly successful, given these facts, Shell\u2019s mere knowledge that spills and leaks continued to occur is insufficient grounds for concluding that Shell \u201carranged for\u201d the disposal of D\u2013D within the meaning of \u00a79607(a)(3).  Accordingly, we conclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the contamination that occurred at B&B\u2019s Arvin facility. \nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger, we need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court\u2019s apportionment of Shell\u2019s liability for the cost of remediation.  We must, however, determine whether the Railroads were properly held jointly and severally liable for the full cost of the Governments\u2019 response efforts.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The seminal opinion on the subject of apportionment in CERCLA actions was written in 1983 by Chief Judge Carl Rubin of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F.\u00a0Supp. 802.  After reviewing CERCLA\u2019s history, Chief Judge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a \u201cstrict liability standard,\u201d id., at 805, it did not mandate \u201cjoint and several\u201d liability in every case.  See id., at 807.  Rather, Congress intended the scope of liability to \u201cbe determined from traditional and evolving principles of common law[.]\u201d  Id., at 808.  The Chem-Dyne approach has been fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals.  See, e.g., In\u00a0re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc., 3 F. 3d 889, 901\u2013902 (CA5 1993); United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964 F. 2d 252, 268 (CA3 1992); O\u2019Neil v. Picillo, 883 F. 2d 176, 178 (CA1 1989); United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F. 2d 160, 171\u2013173 (CA4 1988).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following Chem-Dyne, the courts of appeals have acknowledged that \u201c[t]he universal starting point for divisibility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases\u201d is \u00a7433A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  United States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 717 (CA8 2001); Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. v. Bush, 292 F. 3d 254, 259 (CADC 2002); United States v. R. W. Meyer, Inc., 889 F. 2d 1497, 1507 (CA6 1989).  Under the Restatement,\n\u201cwhen two or more persons acting independently caus[e] a distinct or single harm for which there is a reasonable basis for division according to the contribution of each, each is subject to liability only for the portion of the total harm that he has himself caused.  Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7433A, 881 (1976); Prosser, Law of Torts, pp. 313\u2013314 (4th ed. 1971) \u2026\u00a0.  But where two or more persons cause a single and indivisible harm, each is subject to liability for the entire harm.  Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7875; Prosser, at 315\u2013316.\u201d  Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F. Supp., at 810. \n\nIn other words, apportionment is proper when \u201cthere is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.\u201d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7433A(1)(b), p. 434 (1963\u20131964).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not all harms are capable of apportionment, however, and CERCLA defendants seeking to avoid joint and several liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable basis for apportionment exists.  See Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F. Supp., at 810 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7433B (1976)) (placing burden of proof on party seeking apportionment).  When two or more causes produce a single, indivisible harm, \u201ccourts have refused to make an arbitrary apportionment for its own sake, and each of the causes is charged with responsibility for the entire harm.\u201d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7433A, Comment i, p. 440 (1963\u20131964). \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the parties nor the lower courts dispute the principles that govern apportionment in CERCLA cases, and both the District Court and Court of Appeals agreed that the harm created by the contamination of the Arvin site, although singular, was theoretically capable of apportionment.  The question then is whether the record provided a reasonable basis for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm caused by contamination at the Arvin facility. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a \u201c\u00a0\u2018scorched earth,\u2019 all-or-nothing approach to liability,\u201d failing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of hazardous substances that occurred on their parcel throughout the 13-year period of B&B\u2019s lease.  According to the District Court, the Railroads\u2019 position on liability, combined with the Governments\u2019 refusal to acknowledge the potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the apportioning of liability.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, at 236a\u2013237a (\u201cAll parties \u2026 effectively abdicated providing any helpful arguments to the court and have left the court to independently perform the equitable apportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of the case\u201d).[Footnote 9]  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet despite the parties\u2019 failure to assist the court in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to the proper allocation of liability, the District Court ultimately concluded that this was \u201ca classic \u2018divisible in terms of degree\u2019 case, both as to the time period in which defendants\u2019 conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and as to the estimated maximum contribution of each party\u2019s activities that released hazardous substances that caused Site contamination.\u201d  Id., at 239a.  Consequently, the District Court apportioned liability, assigning the Railroads 9% of the total remediation costs. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court calculated the Railroads\u2019 liability based on three figures.  First, the court noted that the Railroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of the Arvin site.  Second, the court observed that the Railroads had leased their parcel to B&B for 13 years, which was only 45% of the time B&B operated the Arvin facility.  Finally, the court found that the volume of hazardous-substance-releasing activities on the B&B property was at least 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on the Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of two chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D\u2013D), substantially contributed to the contamination that had originated on the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had contributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination requiring remediation.  The court then multiplied .19 by .45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that the Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of the remediation costs.  \u201cAllowing for calculation errors up to 50%,\u201d the court concluded that the Railroads could be held responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost for the Arvin site.  Id., at 252a. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which the District Court\u2019s conclusions rested, finding a lack of sufficient data to establish the precise proportion of contamination that occurred on the relative portions of the Arvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years prior to B&B\u2019s addition of the Railroad parcel.  The court noted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of the leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm caused by activities on the property owned by the Railroads, and\u2014as the court\u2019s upward adjustment confirmed\u2014the court had relied on estimates rather than specific and detailed records as a basis for its conclusions. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts contained in the record reasonably supported the apportionment of liability.  The District Court\u2019s detailed findings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution at the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump and an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the facility most distant from the Railroads\u2019 parcel and that the spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the total site contamination, see id., at 247a\u2013248a, some of which did not require remediation.  With those background facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was reasonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel and the duration of the lease as the starting point for its analysis.  Although the Court of Appeals faulted the District Court for relying on the \u201csimplest of considerations: percentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of hazardous products,\u201d 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the same factors the court had earlier acknowledged were relevant to the apportionment analysis.  See id., at 936, n.18 (\u201cWe of course agree with our sister circuits that, if adequate information is available, divisibility may be established by \u2018volumetric, chronological, or other types of evidence,\u2019 including appropriate geographic considerations\u201d (citations omitted)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court\u2019s assumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were responsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills requiring remediation, observing that each PRP\u2019s share of the total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of pollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total facility.  Although the evidence adduced by the parties did not allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that fewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of those spills that occurred, not all were carried across the Railroad parcel to the B&B sump and pond from which most of the contamination originated.  The fact that no D\u2013D spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends strength to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Railroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in quantities requiring remediation. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court\u2019s conclusion that those two chemicals accounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requiring remediation finds less support in the record; however, any miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the District Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability, which included a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction in liability the District Court provided based on its assessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.  Had the District Court limited its apportionment calculations to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use and the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it would have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response cost.  By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for the Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% \u201cmargin of error,\u201d the District Court reached the same result.  Because the District Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability is supported by the evidence and comports with the apportionment principles outlined above, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Railroads are subject to joint and several liability for all response costs arising out of the contamination of the Arvin facility.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred by holding Shell liable as an arranger under CERCLA for the costs of remediating environmental contamination at the Arvin, California facility.  Furthermore, we conclude that the District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\u2019 share of the site remediation costs\nat 9%.  The judgment is reversed, and the cases are\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX\n\u00a0Because D\u2013D is corrosive, bulk storage of the chemical led to numerous tank failures and spills as the chemical rusted tanks and eroded valves.\n\u00a0F.o.b. destination means \u201cthe seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to [the destination] and there tender delivery of them . . . .\u201d  U. C. C. \u00a72\u2013319(1)(b) (2001).  The District Court found that B&B assumed \u201cstewardship\u201d over the D\u2013D as soon as the common carrier entered the Arvin facility.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601, p. 124a.\n\u00a0The ground water at the Arvin site is divided into three zones.  The A-zone is located 60\u201380 feet below the ground.  It has been tested and found to have high levels of contamination.  The B-zone is located 150 feet below ground.  Although the B-zone is not currently used as a source of drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.  No contamination has yet been found in that zone.  The C-zone is an aquifer located 200 feet below ground.  It is the sole current source of drinking water and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the Arvin site.\n\u00a0Although the Railroads did not produce precise figures regarding the exact quantity of chemical spills on each parcel in each year of the facility\u2019s operation, the District Court found it \u201cindisputable that the overwhelming majority of hazardous substances were released from the B&B parcel.\u201d  Id., at 248a.  The court explained that \u201cthe predominant activities conducted on the Railroad parcel through the years were storage and some washing and rinsing of tanks, other receptacles, and chemical application vehicles.  Mixing, formulating, loading, and unloading of ag-chemical hazardous substances, which contributed most of the liability causing releases, were predominantly carried out by B&B on the B&B parcel.\u201d  Id., at 247a\u2013248a.\n\u00a0For purposes of the statute, a \u201cperson\u201d is defined as \u201can individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, joint venture, commercial entity, United States Government, State, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.\u201d  42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79601(21).  \n\u00a0Under CERCLA, PRPs are liable for: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;\n\n\n\u201c(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan;\n\n\n\u201c(C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release; and\n\n\n\u201c(D) the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under section 9604(i) of this title.\u201d  \u00a79607(a)(4).\n\u00a0\u201cHazardous waste\u201d is defined as \u201ca solid waste, or combination of solid wastes, which \u2026 may . . . pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.\u201d \u00a76903(5)(B); \u00a79601(29).\n\u00a0CERCLA defines \u201chazardous substance\u201d to include a variety of chemicals and toxins including those designated by EPA as air pollutants, water pollutants, and solid wastes.  \u00a79601(14).\n\u00a0As the Governments point out, insofar as the District Court made reference to equitable considerations favoring apportionment, it erred.  Equitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis; rather, apportionment is proper only when the evidence supports the divisibility of the damages jointly caused by the PRPs.  See generally United States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 718\u2013719 (CA8 2001); United States v. Brighton, 153 F. 3d 307, 318\u2013319 (CA6 1998); Redwing Carriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11 1996).  As the Court of Appeals explained, \u201c[a]pportionment . . . looks to whether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establishing a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,\u201d while contribution actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each other on the basis of equitable considerations.  520 F.\u00a03d 918, 939\u2013940 (CA9 2008); see also 42 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a79613(f)(1) (providing that, \u201c[i]n resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate\u201d).  The error is of no consequence, however, because despite the District Court\u2019s reference to equity, its actual apportionment decision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable basis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Railroads.

The IRS later determined the tax shelter was illegal, but offered amnesty under certain conditions. Carlisle was never informed of these developments and was ultimately required to pay taxes and penalties that exceeded $25 million. Carlisle filed suit in a federal district court against nine parties alleging fraud, negligence, civil conspiracy and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p>Before trial, one of the defendants motioned to stay the proceedings pending arbitration with Carlisle per a written agreement with Carlisle. Stay was granted. The remaining defendants motioned seeking their own stay arguing that allowing one party to arbitrate with Carlisle and not allowing the rest would be contradictory. The district court denied the motion. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied it had jurisdiction to review the matter. The parties then appealed the denial of jurisdiction. They argued that Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies and makes available a stay of proceedings in order to arbitrate when there is a written agreement that directs litigated issues into arbitration. Section 16(a)(1) of the FAA then grants appellate jurisdiction over Section 3 motions.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that Section 16(a)(1) did not confer jurisdiction in this case. The court recognized that the appellants were not signatories to the arbitration agreement with Carlisle.

The Supreme Court held that a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction over an appeal from a motion to stay proceedings under Section 16(a)(1) of the Federal Arbitration Act, regardless of whether the petitioner is in fact eligible for a stay. With Justice Antonin G. Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that Section 16 clearly and unambiguously views the underlying merits of the claim irrelevant, but rather looks to the category of order appealed from. In this case, an appeal from a motion to stay proceedings automatically granted the Sixth Circuit jurisdiction. The Court also held that the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that Section 3 of the FAA categorically prevents a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement from pursuing a stay in proceedings. Rather, \"whenever the relevant state law would make a contract to arbitrate a particular dispute enforceable by a non-signatory,\" that person may pursue and obtain a stay under Section 3. Therefore, the Court remanded to the Sixth Circuit to determine whether relevant state law allows the non-signatories to enforce their agreement under state contract law and thus are allowed to pursue a stay in proceedings.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice John Paul Stevens. He argued that \"longstanding congressional policy\" limits the ability of parties to obtain interlocutory appeals. Accordingly, appeals from a denial of a motion to stay proceedings should not be available to those parties who have not even signed the relevant arbitration agreement.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 35553, "name": "M.

The question is whether it opens the door to such an appeal at the behest of one who has not signed a written arbitration agreement.  Based on the longstanding congressional policy limiting interlocutory appeals, I think the better reading of the statutory provisions disallows such an appeal, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 16(a) of the FAA provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken from . . . an order . . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a).  The Court says that any litigant who asks for and is denied a \u00a73 stay is entitled to an immediate appeal.  Ante, at 3.  The majority\u2019s assumption is that \u201cunder section 3\u201d is merely a labeling requirement, without substantive import, but this fails to read \u00a716 in light of the \u201cfirm congressional policy against interlocutory or \u2018piecemeal\u2019 appeals.\u201d  Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The right of appeal is \u201ca creature of statute,\u201d ibid., and Congress has granted the Federal Courts of Appeals jurisdiction to review \u201cfinal decisions,\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.  \u201cThis insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed administration of justice.\u201d  DiBella v. United States, 369 U. S. 121, 124 (1962).  Congress has, however, \u201crecognized the need of exceptions for interlocutory orders in certain types of proceedings where the damage of error unreviewed before the judgment is definitive and complete . . . has been deemed greater than the disruption caused by intermediate appeal.\u201d  Ibid.  Section 16 functions as one such exception, but departures from \u201cthe dominant rule in federal appellate practice,\u201d 9 J. Moore, B. Ward, & J. Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6110.06 (2d ed. 1996), are extraordinary interruptions to the normal process of litigation and ought to be limited carefully.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An obvious way to limit the scope of such an extraordinary interruption would be to read the \u00a716 requirement that the stay have been denied \u201cunder section 3\u201d as calling for a look-through to the provisions of \u00a73, and to read \u00a73 itself as offering a stay only to signatories of an arbitration agreement.  It is perfectly true that in general a third-party beneficiary can enforce a contract, but this is a weak premise for inferring an intent to allow third parties to obtain a \u00a73 stay and take a \u00a716 appeal.  While it is hornbook contract law that third parties may enforce contracts for their benefit as a matter of course, interlocutory appeals are a matter of limited grace.  Because it would therefore seem strange to assume that Congress meant to grant the right to appeal a \u00a73 stay denial to anyone as peripheral to the core agreement as a nonsignatory, it follows that Congress probably intended to limit those able to seek a \u00a73 stay.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asking whether a \u00a73 movant is a signatory provides a bright-line rule with predictable results to aid courts in determining jurisdiction over \u00a716 interlocutory appeals.  And that rule has the further virtue of mitigating the risk of intentional delay by savvy parties who seek to frustrate litigation by gaming the system.  Why not move for a \u00a73 stay?  If granted, arbitration will be mandated, and if denied, a lengthy appeal may wear down the opponent.  The majority contends, ante, at 5, that \u201cthere are ways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals.\u201d  Yes, but the sanctions suggested apply to the frivolous, not to the far-fetched; and as the majority\u2019s opinion concludes, such an attenuated claim of equitable estoppel as petitioners raise here falls well short of the sanctionable.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because petitioners were not parties to the written arbitration agreement, I would hold they could not move to stay the District Court proceedings under \u00a73, with the consequence that the Court of Appeals would have no jurisdiction under \u00a716 to entertain their appeal.  I would accordingly affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit."}, {"id": 1746, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962962, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/624/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1746", "justia_text": "ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP et\u00a0al. v.

Limited liability corporations created by Carlisle, Bushman, and Strassel (also respondents) entered into investment-management agreements with Bricolage Capital, LLC, that provided for arbitration of disputes.  After the Internal Revenue Service found the tax shelter illegal, respondents filed a diversity suit against petitioners.  Claiming that equitable estoppel required respondents to arbitrate their claims per the agreements with Bricolage, petitioners invoked \u00a73 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73, which entitles litigants to stay an action that is \u201creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\u201d  Section 16(a)(1)(A) of the FAA allows an appeal from \u201can order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3.\u201d  The District Court denied petitioners\u2019 stay motions, and the Sixth Circuit dismissed their interlocutory appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of petitioners\u2019 requests for a \u00a73 stay.

Jurisdiction over the appeal \u201cmust be determined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order,\u201d Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311.  The statute unambiguously makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even a request\u2019s utter frivolousness cannot turn a denial into something other than \u201can order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3,\u201d \u00a716(a)(1)(A).

Accordingly, whenever the relevant state law would make a contract to arbitrate a particular dispute enforceable by a nonsignatory, that signatory is entitled to request and obtain a stay under \u00a73 because that dispute is \u201creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\u201d  Because traditional state-law principles allow enforcement of contracts by (or against) nonparties through, e.g., assumption or third-party beneficiary theories, the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that \u00a73 relief is categorically not available to nonsignatories.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a73.  Section 16(a)(1)(A), in turn, allows an appeal from \u201can order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3.\u201d  We address in this case whether appellate courts have jurisdiction under \u00a716(a) to review denials of stays requested by litigants who were not parties to the relevant arbitration agreement, and whether \u00a73 can ever mandate a stay in such circumstances.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents Wayne Carlisle, James Bushman, and Gary Strassel set out to minimize their taxes from the 1999 sale of their construction-equipment company.  Arthur Andersen LLP, a firm that had long served as their company\u2019s accountant, auditor, and tax adviser, introduced them to Bricolage Capital, LLC, which in turn referred them for legal advice to Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP.  According to respondents, these advisers recommended a \u201cleveraged option strategy\u201d tax shelter designed to create illusory losses through foreign-currency-exchange options.  As a part of the scheme, respondents invested in various stock warrants through newly created limited liability corporations (LLCs), which are also respondents in this case.  The respondent LLCs entered into investment-management agreements with Bricolage, specifying that \u201c[a]ny controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the br[ea]ch thereof, shall be settled by arbitration conducted in New York, New York, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d  App. 80\u201381, 99\u2013100, 118\u2013119.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As with all that seems too good to be true, a controversy did indeed arise.  The warrants respondents purchased turned out to be almost entirely worthless, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined in August 2000 that the \u201cleveraged option strategy\u201d scheme was an illegal tax shelter.  The IRS initially offered conditional amnesty to taxpayers who had used such arrangements, but petitioners failed to inform respondents of that option.  Respondents ultimately entered into a settlement program in which they paid the IRS all taxes, penalties, and interest owed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents filed this diversity suit in the Eastern District of Kentucky against Bricolage, Arthur Andersen and others[Footnote 1] (all except Bricolage and its employees hereinafter referred to as petitioners), alleging fraud, civil conspiracy, malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence.  Petitioners moved to stay the action, invoking \u00a73 of the FAA and arguing that the principles of equitable estoppel demanded that respondents arbitrate their claims under their investment agreements with Bricolage.[Footnote 2]  The District Court denied the motions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal, which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Carlisle v. Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP, 521 F.\u00a03d 597, 602 (2008).  We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily, courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of district courts.  28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.  The FAA, however, makes an exception to that finality requirement, providing that \u201can appeal may be taken from \u2026 an order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3 of this title.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a)(1)(A).  By that provision\u2019s clear and unambiguous terms, any litigant who asks for a stay under \u00a73 is entitled to an immediate appeal from denial of that motion\u2014regardless of whether the litigant is in fact eligible for a stay.  Because each petitioner in this case explicitly asked for a stay pursuant to \u00a73, App. 52, 54, 63, 65, the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s denial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts that have declined jurisdiction over \u00a73 appeals of the sort at issue here have done so by conflating the jurisdictional question with the merits of the appeal.  They reason that because stay motions premised on equitable estoppel seek to expand (rather than simply vindicate) agreements, they are not cognizable under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4, and therefore the relevant motions are not actually \u201cunder\u201d those provisions.  See, in addition to the opinion below, 521 F.\u00a03d, at 602, DSMC Inc. v. Convera Corp., 349 F.\u00a03d 679, 682\u2013685 (CADC 2003); In\u00a0re Universal Serv. Fund Tel. Billing Practice Litigation v. Sprint Communications Co., 428 F.\u00a03d 940, 944\u2013945 (CA10 2005).  The dissent makes this step explicit, by reading the appellate jurisdictional provision of \u00a716 as \u201ccalling for a look-through\u201d to the substantive provisions of \u00a73.  Post, at 2.  Jurisdiction over the appeal, however, \u201cmust be determined by focusing upon the category of order appealed from, rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order.\u201d  Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 311 (1996).[Footnote 3]  The jurisdictional statute here unambiguously makes the underlying merits irrelevant, for even utter frivolousness of the underlying request for a \u00a73 stay cannot turn a denial into something other than \u201can order \u2026 refusing a stay of any action under section 3.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a716(a).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents argue that this reading of \u00a716(a) will produce a long parade of horribles, enmeshing courts in fact-intensive jurisdictional inquiries and permitting frivolous interlocutory appeals.  Even if these objections could surmount the plain language of the statute, we would not be persuaded.  Determination of whether \u00a73 was invoked in a denied stay request is immeasurably more simple and less factbound than the threshold determination respondents would replace it with: whether the litigant was a party to the contract (an especially difficult question when the written agreement is not signed).  It is more appropriate to grapple with that merits question after the court has accepted jurisdiction over the case.  Second, there are ways of minimizing the impact of abusive appeals.  Appellate courts can streamline the disposition of meritless claims and even authorize the district court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction when an appeal is certified as frivolous.  See Behrens, supra, at 310\u2013311.  And, of course, those inclined to file dilatory appeals must be given pause by courts\u2019 authority to \u201caward just damages and single or double costs to the appellee\u201d whenever an appeal is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d  Fed. Rule App. Proc. 38.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the Court of Appeals were correct that it had no jurisdiction over meritless appeals, its ground for finding this appeal meritless was in error.  We take the trouble to address that alternative ground, since if the Court of Appeals is correct on the merits point we will have awarded petitioners a remarkably hollow victory.  We consider, therefore, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s underlying determination that those who are not parties to a written arbitration agreement are categorically ineligible for relief.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 2\u2014the FAA\u2019s substantive mandate\u2014makes written arbitration agreements \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d  That provision creates substantive federal law regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements, requiring courts \u201cto place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\u201d  Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Section 3, in turn, allows litigants already in federal court to invoke agreements made enforceable by \u00a72.  That provision requires the court, \u201con application of one of the parties,\u201d[Footnote 4] to stay the action if it involves an \u201cissue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither provision purports to alter background principles of state contract law regarding the scope of agreements (including the question of who is bound by them).  Indeed \u00a72 explicitly retains an external body of law governing revocation (such grounds \u201cas exist at law or in equity\u201d).[Footnote 5]  And we think \u00a73 adds no substantive restriction to \u00a72\u2019s enforceability mandate.  \u201c[S]tate law,\u201d therefore, is applicable to determine which contracts are binding under \u00a72 and enforceable under \u00a73 \u201cif that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d  Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 493, n. 9 (1987).  See also First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944 (1995).  Because \u201ctraditional principles\u201d of state law allow a contract to be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract through \u201cassumption, piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver and estoppel,\u201d 21 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a757:19, p. 183 (4th ed. 2001), the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding that nonparties to a contract are categorically barred from \u00a73 relief was error.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents argue that, as a matter of federal law, claims to arbitration by nonparties are not \u201creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing,\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73 (emphasis added), because they \u201cseek to bind a signatory to an arbitral obligation beyond that signatory\u2019s strictly contractual obligation to arbitrate,\u201d Brief for Respondents 26.  Perhaps that would be true if \u00a73 mandated stays only for disputes between parties to a written arbitration agreement.  But that is not what the statute says.  It says that stays are required if the claims are \u201creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\u201d  If a written arbitration provision is made enforceable against (or for the benefit of) a third party under state contract law, the statute\u2019s terms are fulfilled.[Footnote 6]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents\u2019 final fallback consists of reliance upon dicta in our opinions, such as the statement that \u201carbitration \u2026 is a way to resolve those disputes\u2014but only those disputes\u2014that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration,\u201d First Options, supra, at 943, and the statement that \u201c[i]t goes without saying that a contract cannot bind a nonparty,\u201d EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 294 (2002).  The former statement pertained to issues parties agreed to arbitrate, and the latter referred to an entity (the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) which obviously had no third-party obligations under the contract in question.  Neither these nor any of our other cases have presented for decision the question whether arbitration agreements that are otherwise enforceable by (or against) third parties trigger protection under the FAA.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents may be correct in saying that courts\u2019 application of equitable estoppel to impose an arbitration agreement upon strangers to the contract has been \u201csomewhat loose.\u201d  Brief for Respondents 27, n.\u00a015.  But we need not decide here whether the relevant state contract law recognizes equitable estoppel as a ground for enforcing contracts against third parties, what standard it would apply, and whether petitioners would be entitled to relief under it.  These questions have not been briefed before us and can be addressed on remand.  It suffices to say that no federal law bars the State from allowing petitioners to enforce the arbitration agreement against respondents and that \u00a73 would require a stay in this case if it did.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the denial of petitioners\u2019 request for a \u00a73 stay and that a litigant who was not a party to the relevant arbitration agreement may invoke \u00a73 if the relevant state contract law allows him to enforce the agreement.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0Also named in the suit were two employees of Bricolage (Andrew Beer and Samyak Veera); Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP; William Bricker (the lawyer respondents worked with at the law firm); Prism Connectivity Ventures, LLC (the entity from whom the worthless warrants were purchased); Integrated Capital Associates, Inc. (a prior owner of the worthless warrants who had also been a client of the law firm); and Intercontinental Pacific Group, Inc. (a firm with the same principals as Integrated Capital  Associates).\n\u00a0Bricolage also moved for a stay under \u00a73, but it filed for bankruptcy while its motion was pending, and the District Court denied the motion as moot.\n\u00a0Federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction when an asserted federal claim is \u201c\u00a0\u2018so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998) (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 666 (1974)).  Respondents have not relied upon this line of cases as an alternative rationale for rejection of jurisdiction, and there are good reasons for treating subject-matter jurisdiction differently, in that respect, from the appellate jurisdiction here conferred.  A frivolous federal claim, if sufficient to confer jurisdiction, would give the court power to hear related state-law claims, see 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71367; no such collateral consequences are at issue here.  And while an insubstantial federal claim can be said not to \u201caris[e] under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d \u00a71331, insubstantiality of the merits can hardly convert a judge\u2019s \u201corder \u2026 refusing a stay\u201d into an \u201corder \u2026 refusing\u201d something else.  But we need not resolve this question today.\n\u00a0Respondents do not contest that the term \u201cparties\u201d in \u00a73 refers to parties to the litigation rather than parties to the contract.  The adjacent provision, which explicitly refers to the \u201csubject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties,\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74, unambiguously refers to adversaries in the action, and \u201cidentical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning,\u201d Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224, 232 (2007).  Even without benefit of that canon, we would not be disposed to believe that the statute allows a party to the contract who is not a party to the litigation to apply for a stay of the proceeding.\n\u00a0We have said many times that federal law requires that \u201cquestions of arbitrability \u2026 be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.\u201d  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1983).  Whatever the meaning of this vague prescription, it cannot possibly require the disregard of state law permitting arbitration by or against nonparties to the written arbitration agreement.\n\u00a0We thus reject the dissent\u2019s contention that contract law\u2019s longstanding endorsement of third-party enforcement is \u201ca weak premise for inferring an intent to allow third parties to obtain a \u00a73 stay,\u201d post, at 2.  It seems to us not weak at all, in light of the terms of the statute.  There is no doubt that, where state law permits it, a third-party claim is \u201creferable to arbitration under an agreement in writing.\u201d  It is not our role to conform an unambiguous statute to what we think \u201cCongress probably intended,\u201d post, at 2."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/624/"}, {"ID": 55592, "name": "Vaden v.

DISCOVER\nBANK et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\n[March 9, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Breyer, and Justice Alito join, concurring in part and dissenting in part. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that a federal court asked to compel arbitration pursuant to \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act should \u201clook through\u201d the dispute over arbitrability in determining whether it has jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.  But look through to what?  The statute provides a clear and sensible answer: The court may consider the \u00a74 petition if the court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u00a74 petition in this case explains that the controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether \u201cDiscover Bank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late fees.\u201d  App. 30.  Discover contends in its petition that the resolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law\u2014specifically \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71831d(a) (setting forth the interest rates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may charge \u201cnotwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted\u201d).  Vaden agrees that the legality of Discover\u2019s charges and fees is governed by\nthe FDIA.* A federal court therefore \u201cwould have jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\u201d Discover seeks to arbitrate.  That suit could be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by the fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in this case.  Instead of looking to the controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the controversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether \u201cthe whole controversy,\u201d as reflected in \u201cthe parties\u2019 state-court filings,\u201d arises under federal law.  Ante, at 16 (emphasis added).  Because that litigation was commenced as a state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes there is no \u00a74 jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach is contrary to the language of \u00a74, and sharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate.  The \u201ccontroversy\u201d to which \u00a74 refers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.  The \u00a74 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dispute\u2014the one he seeks to arbitrate\u2014in the \u00a74 petition seeking an order to compel arbitration.  Section 4 requires that the petitioner be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the other party\u2019s \u201cfailure, neglect, or refusal \u2026 to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration\u201d; that language guides the district court to the specific controversy the other party is unwilling to arbitrate.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is clear from the FAA\u2019s repeated and consistent use of the term \u201ccontroversy\u201d to mean the specific dispute asserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader, \u201cfull flavor[ed]\u201d or \u201cfull-bodied\u201d notion of the disagreement between the parties.  Ante, at 17, and n.\u00a016.  In \u00a72, for example, the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is the one \u201cto [be] settle[d] by arbitration\u201d and the one \u201cto [be] submit[ted] to\narbitration.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.  In \u00a710(a)(3), it is a ground for vacating an arbitration award that the arbitrator refused to hear evidence \u201cpertinent and material to the\ncontroversy\u201d\u2014obviously the \u201ccontroversy\u201d subject to\narbitration, or the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to consider the evidence would hardly be objectionable.  In \u00a711(c), an award may be modified if \u201cimperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy\u201d\u2014again, necessarily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore the subject of the award.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason to suppose \u201ccontroversy\u201d meant the controversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the FAA, but something quite different in \u00a74.  The issue is whether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to resolve a controversy; why would the pertinent controversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the same one asserted to be subject to arbitration?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority looks instead to the controversy the state-court litigation seeks to resolve.  This produces the odd result of defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d more broadly than the \u00a74 petition itself.  Discover\u2019s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather Vaden\u2019s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class) violate the FDIA.  See App. 30.  The majority does not appear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute.  The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however, because \u201ca federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s state-law debt-collection claim.\u201d Ante, at 20, n.\u00a019.  There is no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal controversy\u2014the FDIA dispute\u2014because there is no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.  But why Discover should have to demonstrate federal jurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to arbitrate is a mystery.  Cf. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 19\u201321 (1983) (affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition seeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in state-court litigation); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 218\u2013221 (1985) (when litigation involves multiple claims, only some of which are covered by an arbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitration of the covered claims if so requested).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to compel arbitration of entirely state-law claims.  Under that approach the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is not the one the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encompassing the \u201cwhole controversy\u201d between the parties.  Ante, at 16.  If that broader dispute involves both federal and state-law claims, and the \u201coriginating\u201d dispute is federal, ibid., a party could seek arbitration of just the state-law claims.  The \u201ccontroversy\u201d under the majority\u2019s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to \u00a74 jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law claim.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take this case as an example.  If Vaden had filed her FDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a state-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one that \u201ccould be litigated in federal court.\u201d  Ante, at 15.  As a result, the majority\u2019s approach would seem to permit Vaden to file a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the entirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because that dispute would be part and parcel of the \u201cfull flavor[ed],\u201d \u201coriginating\u201d FDIA controversy.  Ante, at 16, 17.  Defining the controversy as the dispute the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring that the actual dispute subject to arbitration is federal. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s conclusion that this controversy \u201cis not one qualifying for federal-court adjudication,\u201d ante, at 19, stems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.  Rather than ask whether a court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca\u201d suit arising out of the \u201ccontroversy,\u201d the majority asks only whether the court does have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a particular complaint.  But \u00a74 does not speak of actual jurisdiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of prospective jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.  The fact that Vaden has chosen to package the FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state-court litigation in no way means that a district court \u201cwould [not] have\u201d jurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca suit\u201d arising out of the FDIA controversy.  A big part of arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of formal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a court to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in a pending case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litigation has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that produces inconsistent results.  Because Discover\u2019s debt-collection claim was filed before Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, the majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the \u201coriginating controversy.\u201d  Ante, at 16.  But nothing would have prevented the same disagreements between the parties from producing a different sequence of events.  Vaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA claims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts Vaden owes.  Because the \u201coriginating controversy\u201d in that complaint would be whether Discover has charged fees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover presumably could bring a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the FDIA dispute.  The majority\u2019s rule thus makes \u00a74 jurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent upon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has unfolded.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in \u00a74 suggests such a result.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority glosses over another problem inherent in its approach: In many if not most cases under \u00a74, no complaint will have been filed.  See Hartford Financial Systems, Inc. v. Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F.\u00a02d 724, 728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (\u201cNormally, [\u00a74] motions are brought in independent proceedings\u201d).  What to \u201clook through\u201d to then?  The majority instructs courts to look to the \u201cfull-bodied controversy.\u201d  Ante, at 17, n.\u00a016.  But as this case illustrates, that would lead to a different result had the state-court complaint not been filed.  Discover does not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt exists; indeed, Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition does not even allege any dispute on that point.  See App. 28\u201341.  A district court would therefore not understand the \u00a74 \u201ccontroversy\u201d to include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the state-court suit.  Under the majority\u2019s rule, the FDIA dispute would be treated as a \u201ccontroversy\u201d qualifying under \u00a74 before the state suit and counterclaims had been filed, but not after.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The far more concrete and administrable approach would be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to the controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u2014as set forth in the \u00a74 petition\u2014and assess whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit arising out of that controversy.  The controversy the moving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will not would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdiction to compel arbitration.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority objects that this would allow a court to \u201chypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,\u201d ante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none.  Not so.  A district court entertaining a \u00a74 petition is required to determine what \u201ca suit\u201d arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy would look like.  There is no helping that, given the statute\u2019s subjunctive language.  But that does not mean the inquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific controversy\u2014the concrete dispute that one party has \u201cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\u201d to arbitrate\u2014and determine whether that controversy would give rise to a suit under federal law.  District courts do that sort of thing often enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the jurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment action.  See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19 (1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action exists when, \u201cif the declaratory judgment defendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit would necessarily present a federal question\u201d (emphasis added)).  Looking to the specific controversy outlined in Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA), it hardly requires \u201cdream[ing]\u201d to conceive of a lawsuit in which Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and Discover would claim it has not.  Ante, at 18.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor would respondents\u2019 approach allow a \u00a74 petitioner to simply \u201crecharacterize\u201d or \u201cmanufacture\u201d a controversy to create federal jurisdiction.  Ante, at 17.  All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable in scrutinizing whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over a suit arising out of the parties\u2019 underlying controversy.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, a federal question must be presented by the specific controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue \u201clurking in the background.\u201d  Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 117 (1936).  A district court could not compel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a potential federal defense that the \u00a74 petitioner is not seeking to arbitrate, because the \u201cclaim itself must present a federal question\u201d to arise under federal law.  Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 672 (1950).  Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a dispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to the filing of a federal counterclaim, for \u201ca counterclaim \u2026 cannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction\u201d of the state-law dispute itself.  Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 831 (2002). \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law claims into federal court through \u00a74 than they can through declaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of action.  To the extent \u00a74 brings some issues into federal court in a particular case that may not be brought in through other procedural mechanisms, it does so by \u201cenlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal courts[,] \u2026 not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.\u201d  Skelly Oil, supra, at 671.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is why the majority\u2019s recital of the basic rules of federal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside the point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no one disputes that they must be followed under \u00a74 in\ndeciding whether a federal court \u201cwould have jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.\u201d  The issue is instead what suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those rules.  In defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d by reference to existing litigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of \u00a74 to the particular suit filed.  The correct approach is to accord \u00a74 the scope mandated by its language and look to \u201ca suit,\u201d arising out of the \u201csubject matter\u201d of the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a federal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority concludes by noting that state courts are obliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.  Ante, at 20.  The question here, however, is one of remedy.  It is a common feature of our federal system that States often provide remedies similar to those under federal law for the same wrongs.  We do not, however, narrowly construe the federal remedies\u2014say federal antitrust or civil rights remedies\u2014because state law provides remedies in those areas as well.  Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183 (1961) (\u201cIt is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give relief\u201d).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden\u2019s account with Discover.  Vaden\u2019s allegations against Discover have given rise to such a dispute.  Discover seeks to arbitrate that controversy, but Vaden refuses to do so.  Resolution of the controversy is governed by federal law, specifically the FDIA.  There is no dispute about that.  In the absence of the arbitration agreement, a federal court \u201cwould have jurisdiction \u2026 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties,\u201d 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74, whether the suit were brought by Vaden or Discover.  The District Court therefore may exercise jurisdiction over this petition under \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n*\u00a0Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely pre-empts her state-law counterclaims.  See 489 F.\u00a03d 594, 604, n.\u00a010 (CA4 2007).  What is significant about that concession is not Vaden\u2019s agreement on the jurisdictional question of complete pre-emption (which we need not and do not address), cf. ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal law\u2014the FDIA\u2014governs her allegation that Discover\u2019s charges and fees are illegal."}, {"id": 1749, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962941, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/49/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1749", "justia_text": "VADEN v.

Discover\u2019s pleading presented a claim arising solely under state law.  Vaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Discover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated state law.  Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in Federal District Court to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.  The District Court ordered arbitration.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On Vaden\u2019s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law.  The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct this inquiry by \u201clooking through\u201d the \u00a74 petition to the substantive controversy between the parties.  With Vaden conceding that her state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by \u00a727 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbitration.  The Fourth Circuit then affirmed.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and may not be predicated on counterclaims.  It concluded, however, that the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides the well-pleaded complaint rule. \nHeld:\u00a0A federal court may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine whether it is predicated on a controversy that \u201carises under\u201d federal law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a \u00a74 petition based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole controversy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudication.  Pp.\u00a06\u201321.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Congress enacted the FAA \u201c[t]o overcome judicial resistance to arbitration,\u201d Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.

To that end, \u00a72 makes arbitration agreements in contracts \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\u201d while \u00a74 provides for federal district court enforcement of those agreements.  The \u201cbody of federal substantive law\u201d generated by elaboration of \u00a72 is equally binding on state and federal courts.  Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 12.

Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152.  Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826.  A complaint purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one \u201carising under\u201d federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to recharacterization, remains nonremovable.  Pp.\u00a06\u201311.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0FAA \u00a74\u2019s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by \u201clooking through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to the parties\u2019 underlying substantive controversy.  The phrase \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it \u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d over \u201cthe controversy between the parties,\u201d which is most straightforwardly read to mean the \u201cunderlying dispute\u201d between the parties.  See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32.  Vaden\u2019s argument that the relevant \u201ccontroversy\u201d is simply and only the parties\u2019 discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult to square with \u00a74\u2019s language.  If courts are to determine whether they would have jurisdiction \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d how can a dispute over an arbitration agreement\u2019s existence or applicability be the controversy that counts?  The Court is unpersuaded that the \u201csave for\u201d clause means only that the \u201cantiquated and arcane\u201d ouster notion no longer holds sway.  To the extent that the ancient \u201couster\u201d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, FAA \u00a72, the Act\u2019s \u201ccenterpiece provision,\u201d Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625, directly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any other contract.  Vaden\u2019s approach also has curious practical consequences.  It would permit a federal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not accommodate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in, or remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so.  In contrast, the \u201clook through\u201d approach permits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit.  Pp.\u00a011\u201315.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Having determined that a district court should look through a \u00a74 petition, this Court considers whether the court \u201cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\u201d between Discover and Vaden.  Because \u00a74 does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain such a court\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the entire, actual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  Here, the actual controversy is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.  The \u201ccontroversy between the parties\u201d arose from Vaden\u2019s \u201calleged debt,\u201d a claim that plainly did not \u201carise under\u201d federal law; nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit misapprehended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper because Vaden\u2019s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal court\u2019s door.  Vaden\u2019s responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are merely an aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involving that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.  Section 4 does not give parties license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling arbitration.  It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Section 4 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\u2019 controversy.  Allowing parties to commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 controversy pending in state court makes scant sense.  Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the \u00a74 inquiry.  Although FAA \u00a74 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration here, Discover is not left without recourse.  Because the FAA obliges both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agreements, Discover may petition Maryland\u2019s courts for appropriate aid in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland credit cardholders.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a74, authorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  We consider in this opinion two questions concerning a district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration pursuant to \u00a74, \u201clook through\u201d the petition and grant the requested relief if the court would have federal-question jurisdiction over the underlying controversy?  And if the answer to that question is yes, may a district court exercise jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition when the petitioner\u2019s complaint rests on state law but an actual or potential counterclaim rests on federal law?  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The litigation giving rise to these questions began when Discover Bank\u2019s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland state court.  Presenting a claim arising solely under state law, Discover sought to recover past-due charges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.  Vaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Discover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated state law.  Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.  The District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its petition, Discover maintained, because Vaden\u2019s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by federal banking law.  The District Court agreed and ordered arbitration.  Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition if the parties\u2019 underlying dispute presents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually affirmed.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part.  A federal court may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition and order arbitration if, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d the court would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe [substantive] controversy between the parties.\u201d  We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals misidentified the dimensions of \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d  Focusing on only a slice of the parties\u2019 entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that basis affirmed the District Court\u2019s order compelling arbitration.  Lost from sight was the triggering plea\u2014Discover\u2019s claim for the balance due on Vaden\u2019s account.  Given that entirely state-based plea and the established rule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole \u201ccontroversy between the parties\u201d does not qualify for federal-court adjudication.  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law-based contract action: Discover sued its cardholder, Vaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages amounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.[Footnote 1]  Vaden\u2019s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.  Vaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class actions.  Like Discover\u2019s complaint, Vaden\u2019s pleadings invoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover\u2019s demands for finance charges, interest, and late fees violated Maryland\u2019s credit laws.  See Md. Com. Law Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712\u2013506, 12\u2013506.2 (Lexis 2005).  Neither party invoked\u2014by notice to the other or petition to the state court\u2014the clause in the credit card agreement providing for arbitration of \u201cany claim or dispute between [Discover and Vaden],\u201d App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface omitted).[Footnote 2]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faced with Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, Discover sought federal-court aid.  It petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant to \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74, compelling arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.[Footnote 3]  Although those counterclaims were framed under state law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely by federal law, specifically, \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71831d(a).  Section 27(a) prescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally insured banks like Discover can charge, \u201cnotwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted.\u201d  This provision, Discover maintained, was completely preemptive, i.e., it superseded otherwise applicable Maryland law, and placed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims under the exclusive governance of the FDIA.  On that basis, Discover asserted, the District Court had authority to entertain the \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d federal law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted Discover\u2019s petition, ordered arbitration, and stayed Vaden\u2019s prosecution of her counterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitration.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a\u201390a.  On Vaden\u2019s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District Court had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition.  To make that determination, the Court of Appeals instructed, the District Court should \u201clook through\u201d the \u00a74 petition to the substantive controversy between the parties.  396 F.\u00a03d 366, 369, 373 (2005).  The appellate court then remanded the case for an express determination whether that controversy presented \u201ca properly invoked federal question.\u201d  Id., at 373. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, Vaden \u201cconcede[d] that the FDIA completely preempts any state claims against a federally insured bank.\u201d  409 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 632, 636 (Md. 2006).    Accepting this concession, the District Court expressly held that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition and again ordered arbitration.  Id., at 634\u2013636, 639.  In this second round, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, dividing 2 to 1.  489 F.\u00a03d 594 (2007).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing that \u201ca party may not create jurisdiction by concession,\u201d id., at 604, n.\u00a010, the Fourth Circuit majority conducted its own analysis of FDIA \u00a727(a), ultimately concluding that the provision completely preempted state law and therefore governed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.[Footnote 4]  This Court\u2019s decision in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), the majority recognized, held that federal-question jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and may not be predicated on counterclaims.  489 F.\u00a03d, at 600, n.\u00a04.  Nevertheless, the majority concluded, the complete preemption doctrine is paramount, \u201coverrid[ing] such fundamental cornerstones of federal subject-matter jurisdiction as the well-pleaded complaint rule.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting 14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73722.1, p. 511 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright & Miller)).[Footnote 5]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissenting judge considered Holmes Group dispositive.  As \u00a727(a) of the FDIA formed no part of Discover\u2019s complaint, but came into the case only as a result of Vaden\u2019s responsive pleadings, the dissent reasoned, \u201c[t]here was no \u2018properly invoked federal question\u2019 in the underlying state case.\u201d  489 F.\u00a03d, at 610.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), in view of the conflict among lower federal courts on whether district courts, petitioned to order arbitration pursuant to \u00a74 of the FAA, may \u201clook through\u201d the petition and examine the parties\u2019 underlying dispute to determine whether federal-question jurisdiction exists over the \u00a74 petition.  Compare Wisconsin v. Ho-Chunk Nation, 463 F.\u00a03d 655, 659 (CA7 2006) (in determining jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition, the court may not \u201clook through\u201d the petition and focus on the underlying dispute); Smith Barney, Inc. v. Sarver, 108 F.\u00a03d 92, 94 (CA6 1997) (same); Westmoreland Capital Corp. v. Findlay, 100 F.\u00a03d 263, 267\u2013269 (CA2 1996) (same); and Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. v. Fitch, 966 F.\u00a02d 981, 986\u2013989 (CA5 1992) (same), with Community State Bank v. Strong, 485 F.\u00a03d 597, 605\u2013606 (court may \u201clook through\u201d the petition and train on the underlying dispute), vacated, reh\u2019g en banc granted, 508 F.\u00a03d 576 (CA11 2007);[Footnote 6] and 396 F.\u00a03d, at 369\u2013370 (case below) (same).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this case shows, if the underlying dispute is the proper focus of a \u00a74 petition, a further question may arise.  The dispute brought to state court by Discover concerned Vaden\u2019s failure to pay over $10,000 in past-due credit card charges.  In support of that complaint, Discover invoked no federal law.  When Vaden answered and counterclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law, specifically \u00a727(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on which Vaden relied.  What counts as the underlying dispute in a case so postured?  May Discover invoke \u00a74, not on the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal element, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by Vaden? To answer these questions, we first review relevant provisions of the FAA, 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 et seq., and controlling tenets of federal jurisdiction.  \nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1925, Congress enacted the FAA \u201c[t]o overcome judicial resistance to arbitration,\u201d Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443 (2006), and to declare \u201c\u00a0\u2018a national policy favoring arbitration\u2019 of claims that parties contract to settle in that manner,\u201d Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10 (1984)).  To that end, \u00a72 provides that arbitration agreements in contracts \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d are \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.[Footnote 7]  Section 4\u2014the section at issue here\u2014provides for United States district court enforcement of arbitration agreements.  Petitions to compel arbitration, \u00a74 states, may be brought before \u201cany United States district court which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28 \u2026 of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  See supra, at 3, n.\u00a03.[Footnote 8] \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cbody of federal substantive law\u201d generated by elaboration of FAA \u00a72 is equally binding on state and federal courts.  Southland, 465 U. S., at 12 (quoting Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32 (1983)); accord Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 271\u2013272 (1995).  \u201cAs for jurisdiction over controversies touching arbitration,\u201d however, the Act is \u201csomething of an anomaly\u201d in the realm of federal legislation: It \u201cbestow[s] no federal jurisdiction but rather requir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional basis\u201d over the parties\u2019 dispute.  Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32).[Footnote 9]  Given the substantive supremacy of the FAA, but the Act\u2019s nonjurisdictional cast, state courts have a prominent role to play as enforcers of agreements to arbitrate.  See Southland, 465 U. S., at 15; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, and n. 32.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The independent jurisdictional basis Discover relies upon in this case is 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, which vests in federal district courts jurisdiction over \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d  Under the longstanding well-pleaded complaint rule, however, a suit \u201carises under\u201d federal law \u201conly when the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon [federal law].\u201d  Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908).  Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an actual or anticipated defense: \u201cIt is not enough that the plaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of action and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some provision of [federal law].\u201d  Ibid. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor can federal jurisdiction rest upon an actual or anticipated counterclaim.  We so ruled, emphatically, in Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826.  Without dissent, the Court held in Holmes Group that a federal counterclaim, even when compulsory, does not establish \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction.[Footnote 10]  Adhering assiduously to the well-pleaded complaint rule, the Court observed, inter alia, that it would undermine the clarity and simplicity of that rule if federal courts were obliged to consider the contents not only of the complaint but also of responsive pleadings in determining whether a case \u201carises under\u201d federal law.  Id., at 832.  See also id., at 830 (\u201c[T]he well-pleaded complaint rule, properly understood, [does not] allo[w] a counterclaim to serve as the basis for a district court\u2019s \u2018arising under\u2019 jurisdiction.\u201d); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 10\u201311, and n. 9 (1983) (\u201cThe well-pleaded complaint rule applies to the original jurisdiction of the district courts as well as to their removal jurisdiction.\u201d).[Footnote 11]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A complaint purporting to rest on state law, we have recognized, can be recharacterized as one \u201carising under\u201d federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively federal.  See Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8 (2003).  Under this so-called \u201ccomplete preemption doctrine,\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cstate cause of action [may be recast] as a federal claim for relief, making [its] removal [by the defendant] proper on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.\u201d  14B Wright & Miller \u00a73722.1, p. 511.[Footnote 12]  A state-law-based counterclaim, however, even if similarly susceptible to recharacterization, would remain nonremovable.  Under our precedent construing \u00a71331, as just explained, counterclaims, even if they rely exclusively on federal substantive law, do not qualify a case for federal-court cognizance.  \nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attending to the language of the FAA and the above-described jurisdictional tenets, we approve the \u201clook through\u201d approach to this extent: A federal court may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine whether it is predicated on an action that \u201carises under\u201d federal law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a \u00a74 petition based on the contents, actual or hypothetical, of a counterclaim.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of \u00a74 drives our conclusion that a federal court should determine its jurisdiction by \u201clooking through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to the parties\u2019 underlying substantive controversy.  We reiterate \u00a74\u2019s relevant instruction: When one party seeks arbitration pursuant to a written agreement and the other resists, the proponent of arbitration may petition for an order compelling arbitration in\n\u201cany United States district court which, save for [the arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.\n\nThe phrase \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the arbitration agreement and determine whether it \u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d without it.  See 396 F.\u00a03d, at 369, 372 (case below).  Jurisdiction over what?  The text of \u00a74 refers us to \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d  That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we agree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the \u201csubstantive conflict between the parties.\u201d  Id., at 370.  See also Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32 (noting in dicta that, to entertain a \u00a74 petition, a federal court must have jurisdiction over the \u201cunderlying dispute\u201d).[Footnote 13]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority of Courts of Appeals to address the question, we acknowledge, have rejected the \u201clook through\u201d approach entirely, as Vaden asks us to do here.  See supra, at 5\u20136.  The relevant \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d Vaden insists, is simply and only the parties\u2019 discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims.  She relies, quite reasonably, on the fact that a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the underlying controversy.  Indeed, its very purpose is to have an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.  A \u00a74 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for specific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it thus presents principally contractual questions: Did the parties validly agree to arbitrate?  What issues does their agreement encompass?  Has one party dishonored the agreement?  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vaden\u2019s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to square with the statutory language.  Section 4 directs courts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d  How, then, can a dispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration agreement be the controversy that counts?  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u201csave for\u201d clause, courts espousing the view embraced by Vaden respond, means only that the \u201cantiquated and arcane\u201d ouster notion no longer holds sway.  Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. v. Valenzuela Bock, 696 F.\u00a0Supp. 957, 961 (SDNY 1988).  Adherents to this \u201couster\u201d explanation of \u00a74\u2019s language recall that courts traditionally viewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to \u201coust\u201d them of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against encroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific enforcement of agreements to arbitrate.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1\u20132 (1924) (discussed in Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219\u2013220, and n. 6 (1985)).  The \u201csave for\u201d clause, as comprehended by proponents of the \u201couster\u201d explanation, was designed to ensure that courts would no longer consider themselves ousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically enforce arbitration agreements.  See, e.g., Westmoreland, 100 F. 3d, at 267\u2013268, and n. 6 (adopting the \u201couster\u201d interpretation advanced in Drexel Burnham Lambert, 696 F.\u00a0Supp., at 961\u2013963); Strong, 485 F.\u00a03d, at 631 (Marcus, J., specially concurring) (reading \u00a74\u2019s \u201csave for\u201d clause \u201cas instructing the court to \u2018set aside\u2019 not the arbitration agreement \u2026 , but merely the previous judicial hostility to arbitration agreements\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not persuaded that the \u201couster\u201d explanation of \u00a74\u2019s \u201csave for\u201d clause carries the day.  To the extent that the ancient \u201couster\u201d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitration agreements, \u00a72 of the FAA, the Act\u2019s \u201ccenterpiece provision,\u201d Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625 (1985), directly attended to the problem.  Covered agreements to arbitrate, \u00a72 declares, are \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d  Having commanded that an arbitration agreement is enforceable just as any other contract, Congress had no cause to repeat the point.  See 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law \u00a79.2.3.3, p.\u00a09:18 (1995) (hereinafter MacNeil) (\u201cTh[e] effort to connect the \u2018save for\u2019 language to the ancient problem of \u2018ouster of jurisdiction\u2019 is imaginative, but utterly unfounded and historically inaccurate.\u201d (footnote omitted)).[Footnote 14]      \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to its textual implausibility, the approach Vaden advocates has curious practical consequences.  It would permit a federal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitrability involves a maritime contract.  See, e.g., Westmoreland, 100 F.\u00a03d, at 268\u2013269; 1 MacNeil \u00a79.2.3.1, pp.\u00a09:12\u20139:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or removed to federal court, the court \u201cmay order arbitration under FAA \u00a74\u201d).[Footnote 15]  Vaden\u2019s approach would not accommodate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not done so.  In contrast, when the parties\u2019 underlying dispute arises under federal law, the \u201clook through\u201d approach permits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal step of initiating or removing a federal-question suit\u2014that is, without seeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants to arbitrate rather than litigate.  See 1 id., \u00a79.2.3.3, p.\u00a09:21 (explaining that the approach Vaden advocates \u201ccreates a totally artificial distinction\u201d based on whether a dispute is subject to pending federal litigation).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having determined that a district court should \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition, we now consider whether the court \u201cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\u201d between Discover and Vaden.  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74.  As explained above, \u00a74 of the FAA does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction; rather, it confines federal courts to the jurisdiction they would have \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d  See supra, at 7\u20138.  Mindful of that limitation, we read \u00a74 to convey that a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal court\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the entire, actual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they have framed it, could be litigated in federal court.  We conclude that the parties\u2019 actual controversy, here precipitated by Discover\u2019s state-court suit for the balance due on Vaden\u2019s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudication.  Consequently, the \u00a74 petition Discover filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland must be dismissed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Fourth Circuit initially stated, the \u201ccontroversy between the parties\u201d arose from the \u201calleged debt\u201d Vaden owed to Discover.  396 F.\u00a03d, at 370.  Discover\u2019s complaint in Maryland state court plainly did not \u201carise under\u201d federal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of federal-court jurisdiction.  See supra, at 3, and n.\u00a01.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court jurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover\u2019s complaint and homed in on Vaden\u2019s state-law-based defense and counterclaims.  Those responsive pleadings, Discover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were completely preempted by the FDIA.  See supra, at 3\u20134.  The Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our decision in Holmes Group.  Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a counterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of opening a federal court\u2019s door.  See supra, at 8\u201311.  See also Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75\u201376 (1914) (\u201c[W]hether a case is one arising under [federal law] . . . must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by anything alleged in anticipation o[r] avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither Discover nor The Chief Justice, concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent), defends the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the dissent insists that a federal court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate\u201d\u2014namely, \u201cwhether \u2018Discover Bank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late fees.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Post, at 1 (quoting App. 30).  The dissent hypothesizes two federal suits that might arise from this purported controversy: \u201can action by Vaden asserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.\u201d  Post, at 2.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a fundamental flaw in the dissent\u2019s analysis: In lieu of focusing on the whole controversy as framed by the parties, the dissent hypothesizes discrete controversies of its own design.  As the parties\u2019 state-court filings reflect, the originating controversy here concerns Vaden\u2019s alleged debt to Discover.  Vaden\u2019s responsive counterclaims challenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are a discrete aspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state court.  Whether one might imagine a federal-question suit involving the parties\u2019 disagreement over Discover\u2019s charges is beside the point.  The relevant question is whether the whole controversy between the parties\u2014not just a piece broken off from that controversy\u2014is one over which the federal courts would have jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent would have us treat a \u00a74 petitioner\u2019s statement of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant controversy even when that statement does not convey the full flavor of the parties\u2019 entire dispute.  Artful dodges by a \u00a74 petitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual dimensions of that controversy.  The text of \u00a74 instructs federal courts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy between the parties\u201d; it does not give \u00a74 petitioners license to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling arbitration.[Footnote 16]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly \u201cfortuit[ous]\u201d that the controversy in this case took the shape it did.  Cf. post, at 2.  Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counterclaims.  Perhaps events could have unfolded differently, but \u00a74 does not invite federal courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\u2019 controversy.[Footnote 17]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer a federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitration while leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 controversy pending in state court.  That seems a bizarre way to proceed.  In this case, Vaden\u2019s counterclaims would be sent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are addressed\u2014Discover\u2019s state-law-grounded debt-collection action\u2014would remain pending in a Maryland court.  When the controversy between the parties is not one over which a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes scant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal court to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out issues for separate resolution.[Footnote 18]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is totally preempted by federal law may complicate the dissent\u2019s \u00a74 inquiry.  This case is illustrative.  The dissent relates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA \u00a727(a), not Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover may impose.  Post, at 1\u20132.  But because the issue is jurisdictional, Vaden\u2019s concession is not determinative.  See supra, at 4\u20135, and n.\u00a04.  The dissent simply glides by the preemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although this Court has not yet resolved the matter.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, \u00a74 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to compel arbitration to inquire whether the court would have jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d  We read that prescription in light of the well-pleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal jurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or counterclaim.  Parties may not circumvent those rules by asking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of a controversy that implicates federal law when the court would not have federal-question jurisdiction over the controversy as a whole.  It does not suffice to show that a federal question lurks somewhere inside the parties\u2019 controversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise under federal law.  Because the controversy between Discover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualifying for federal-court adjudication, \u00a74 of the FAA does not empower a federal court to order arbitration of that controversy, in whole or in part.[Footnote 19]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discover, we note, is not left without recourse.  Under the FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.  Southland, 465 U. S., at 12; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, 26, n. 34.  See also supra, at 7\u20138.  Discover may therefore petition a Maryland court for aid in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland cardholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True, Maryland\u2019s high court has held that \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 of the FAA prescribe federal-court procedures and, therefore, do not bind the state courts.[Footnote 20]  But Discover scarcely lacks an available state remedy.  Section 2 of the FAA, which does bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d  This provision \u201ccarries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration agreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on federal courts by FAA \u00a7\u00a73 and 4.\u201d  1 MacNeil \u00a710.8.1, p.\u00a010:77.  Notably, Maryland, like many other States, provides a statutory remedy nearly identical to \u00a74.  See Md. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013207 (Lexis 2006) (\u201cIf a party to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate, the other party may file a petition with a court to order arbitration. . . .  If the court determines that the agreement exists, it shall order arbitration.  Otherwise it shall deny the petition.\u201d).  See also Walther v. Sovereign Bank, 386 Md. 412, 424, 872 A. 2d 735, 742 (2005) (\u201cThe Maryland Arbitration Act has been called the \u2018State analogue \u2026 to the Federal Arbitration Act.\u2019  The same policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements is present in both our own and the federal acts.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  Even before it filed its debt-recovery action in a Maryland state court, Discover could have sought from that court an order compelling arbitration of any agreement-related dispute between itself and cardholder Vaden.  At no time was federal-court intervention needed to place the controversy between the parties before an arbitrator.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the District Court\u2019s order is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0Discover apparently had no access to a federal forum for its suit against Vaden on the basis of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  Under that head of federal-court jurisdiction, the amount in controversy must \u201cexcee[d] \u2026 $75,000.\u201d  28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71332(a).\n\u00a0Vaden\u2019s preference for court adjudication is unsurprising.  The arbitration clause, framed by Discover, prohibited presentation of \u201cany claims as a representative or member of a class.\u201d  App. 45 (capitalization omitted).  \n\u00a0Section 4 reads, in relevant part:\n\n\n\u201cA party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States district court which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a74. \n\u00a0Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to take up the question of \u00a727(a)\u2019s preemptive force generally or in the particular context of Discover\u2019s finance charges.  We therefore express no opinion on those issues.  Cf. Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 9\u201310 (2003) (holding that the National Bank Act, 12 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a785, 86, completely preempts state-law usury claims against national banks).  \n\u00a0But see 489 F.\u00a03d 594, 612 (CA4 2007) (dissenting opinion) (observing that the passage from Wright & Miller referenced by the majority \u201cmakes clear that the doctrine of complete preemption is exclusively focused on claims in a plaintiff\u2019s complaint\u201d).  \n\u00a0In Community State Bank v. Strong, 485 F. 3d 597, 605\u2013606 (CA11 2007), the Court of Appeals approved the \u201clook through\u201d approach as advanced in circuit precedent.  But Judge Marcus, who authored the court\u2019s unanimous opinion, wrote a special concurrence, noting that, were he writing on a clean slate, he would reject the \u201clook through\u201d approach.\n\u00a0Section 2 reads, in full:\n\n\n\u201cA written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.    \n\u00a0A companion provision, \u00a73, provides for stays of litigation pending arbitration.  It reads:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a73.\n\u00a0Chapter 2 of the FAA, not implicated here, does expressly grant federal courts jurisdiction to hear actions seeking to enforce an agreement or award falling under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.  See 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7203 (\u201cAn action or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States.  The district courts of the United States \u2026 shall have original jurisdiction over such an action or proceeding \u2026\u00a0.\u201d).  FAA \u00a7205 goes further and overrides the well-pleaded complaint rule pro tanto.  9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7205 (\u201cThe procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply, except that the ground for removal provided in this section need not appear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition for removal.\u201d).  As Vaden points out, these sections demonstrate that \u201cwhen Congress wants to expand [federal-court] jurisdiction, it knows how to do so clearly and unequivocally.\u201d  Brief for Petitioner 38.\n\u00a0Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), involved 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71295(a)(1), which vests in the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over \u201can appeal from a final decision of a district court \u2026 if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on [28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7]1338.\u201d  Section 1338(a), in turn, confers on district courts \u201c[exclusive] original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.\u201d  The plaintiff\u2019s complaint in Holmes Group presented a federal claim, but not one relating to patents; the defendant counterclaimed for patent infringement.  The Court ruled that the case did not \u201caris[e] under\u201d the patent laws by virtue of the patent counterclaim, and therefore held that the Federal Circuit lacked appellate jurisdiction under \u00a71295(a)(1).  See 535 U. S., at 830\u2013832.\n\n\nIn reaching its decision in Holmes Group, the Court first attributed to the words \u201carising under\u201d in \u00a71338(a) the same meaning those words have in \u00a71331.  See id., at 829\u2013830.  It then reasoned that a counterclaim asserted in a responsive pleading cannot provide the basis for \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction consistently with the well-pleaded complaint rule.  See id., at 830\u2013832.  \n\u00a0The Court noted in Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 10\u201311, n.\u00a09 (1983), and in Holmes Group, 535 U. S., at 831, that commentators have repeatedly suggested Judicial Code revisions under which responsive pleadings that may be dispositive would count in determining whether a case \u201carises under\u201d federal law.  See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts \u00a71312, pp. 188\u2013194 (1969) (discussed in 14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73722, pp. 505\u2013507 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright & Miller)); cf. Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law & Contemp. Prob. 216, 233\u2013234 (1948).  Congress, however, has not responded to these suggestions.\n\u00a0Recharacterization of an asserted state-law claim as in fact a claim arising exclusively under federal law, and therefore removable on the defendant\u2019s petition, of course does not mean that the claim cannot remain in state court.  There is nothing inappropriate or exceptional, Discover acknowledges, about a state court\u2019s entertaining, and applying federal law to, completely preempted claims or counterclaims.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.  \n\u00a0The parties\u2019 underlying dispute may or may not be the subject of pending litigation.  This explains \u00a74\u2019s use of the conditional \u201cwould\u201d and the indefinite \u201ca suit.\u201d  A party often files a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration precisely because it does not want to bring suit and litigate in court.  Sometimes, however, a \u00a74 petition is filed after litigation has commenced.  The party seeking to compel arbitration in such cases is typically the defendant, who claims to be aggrieved by the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to litigate rather than arbitrate.  This case involves the relatively unusual situation in which the party that initiated litigation of the underlying dispute is also the party seeking to compel arbitration.\n\u00a0Because \u201cthe ouster problem was just as great under state law as it was under federal,\u201d the absence of \u201csave for\u201d language in contemporaneous state arbitration acts bolsters our conclusion that \u00a74 was not devised to dislodge the common-law ouster doctrine.  1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law \u00a79.2.3.3, p.\u00a09:18 (1995).  See also 396 F.\u00a03d 366, 369\u2013370, n.\u00a02 (CA4 2005) (case below).  \n\u00a0Specific jurisdiction-granting provisions may also authorize a federal court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration.  See, e.g., 9 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7203, 205 (providing for federal-court jurisdiction over arbitration agreements covered by the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).\n\u00a0Noting that the FAA sometimes uses \u201ccontroversy\u201d to refer to the dispute to be arbitrated, the dissent insists that it must have the same meaning in \u00a74.  Cf. post, at 2\u20133.  But \u00a74 does not ask a district court to determine whether it would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u201d; it asks whether the court would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d  Here, the issue Discover seeks to arbitrate is undeniably only a fraction of the controversy between the parties.  We decline to rewrite the statute to ignore this reality.  \n\n\nMoreover, our reading of \u00a74 fully accords with the statute\u2019s subjunctive construction (\u201cwould have jurisdiction\u201d) and its reference to \u201ca suit.\u201d  Cf. post, at 5.  Section 4, we recognize, enables a party to seek an order compelling arbitration even when the parties\u2019 controversy is not the subject of pending litigation.  See supra, at 12, n.\u00a013, 14\u201315.  Whether or not the controversy between the parties is embodied in an existing suit, the relevant question remains the same: Would a federal court have jurisdiction over an action arising out of that full-bodied controversy?   \nOur approach, the dissent asserts, would produce \u201cinconsistent results\u201d based \u201cupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has unfolded.\u201d  Post, at 5, 6.  Of course, a party\u2019s ability to gain adjudication of a federal question in federal court often depends on how that question happens to have been presented, and the dissent\u2019s argument is little more than a veiled criticism of Holmes Group and the well-pleaded complaint rule.  When a litigant files a state-law claim in state court, and her opponent parries with a federal counterclaim, the action is not removable to federal court, even though it would have been removable had the order of filings been reversed.  See Holmes Group, 535 U. S., at 831\u2013832.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True, the outcome in this case may well have been different had Vaden initiated an FDIA claim about the legality of Discover\u2019s charges.  Because that controversy likely would have been amenable to adjudication in a federal forum, Discover could have asked a federal court to send the parties to arbitration.  But that is not what occurred here.  Vaden did not invoke the FDIA.  Indeed, she framed her counterclaims under state law and clearly preferred the Maryland forum.  The dissent\u2019s hypothesizing about the case that might have been brought does not provide a basis for federal-court jurisdiction.\n\u00a0The dissent observes, post, at 4, that our rule might enable a party to request a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling arbitration of a state-law counterclaim that might otherwise be adjudicated in state court.  But if a federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 whole controversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court\u2019s ordering arbitration of a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy.  Federal courts routinely exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims.  See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367.\n\u00a0This Court\u2019s declaratory judgment jurisprudence in no way undercuts our analysis.  Cf. post, at 2, 7.  Discover, the dissent implies, could have brought suit in federal court seeking a declaration that its charges conform to federal law.  Again, the dissent\u2019s position rests on its misconception of \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d  Like \u00a74 itself, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the federal courts; it is \u201cprocedural only.\u201d  Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937).  Thus, even in a declaratory judgment action, a federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s state-law debt-collection claim.  Cf. 10B Wright & Miller \u00a72758, pp. 519\u2013521 (\u201cThe Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended to enable a party to obtain a change of tribunal from a state to federal court, and it is not the function of the federal declaratory action merely to anticipate a defense that otherwise could be presented in a state action.\u201d (footnote omitted)).\nThis Court has not decided whether \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 apply to proceedings in state courts, see Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 477, n. 6 (1989), and we do not do so here."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/49/"}, {"ID": 55593, "name": "Summers v.

He was sentenced to 151 months imprisonment. Mr. Boyle appealed arguing that the government's case against him was factually contradictory. In his trial, the government charged that the robbery was an act of the Boyle Crew enterprise. However, in a previous case it had charged that the robbery was an act of the New Springfield Boys enterprise. Boyle maintained that this contradiction violated his right to due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the government's case was not factually contradictory. It reasoned that \"[n]othing dictates that a single crime cannot be committed by two enterprises working together, each in furtherance of its own interests.\" Thus, the trial court did not violate Boyle's Fifth Amendment due process rights.</p>\n", "question": "<p>In order prove the association of enterprises in a criminal activity, does the government need to show connections between the enterprises beyond what is apparent in the criminal activity itself?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court held that, under RICO, the association between criminal enterprises must be shown to have a \"structure,\" but the relevant jury instructions need not spell out the precise elements which need be found. With Justice Samuel A. Alito writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court reasoned that a jury need not be instructed to find an \"ascertainable structure\" in order to find the association of enterprises because such instructions would be redundant as the jury is already tasked with finding the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt from which it may infer a \"structure\" of criminal association.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens dissented and was joined by Justice Stephen G. Breyer. He argued that Congress merely intended RICO to apply to \"business-like entities,\" and thus the majority's ruling extended RICO liability far beyond Congress' intent.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 35838, "name": "Marc Fernich", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/marc_fernich", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Fernich", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "marc_fernich"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19800"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 17293, "name": "Anthony A.

UNITED\nSTATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit\n[June 8, 2009]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, Congress intended the term \u201centerprise\u201d as it is used in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71961 et seq., to refer only to business-like entities that have an existence apart from the predicate acts committed by their employees or associates.  The trial judge in this case committed two significant errors relating to the meaning of that term.  First, he instructed the jury that \u201can association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\u201d can constitute an enterprise.  App. 112.  And he allowed the jury to find that element satisfied by evidence showing a group of criminals with no existence beyond its intermittent commission of racketeering acts and related offenses.  Because the Court\u2019s decision affirming petitioner\u2019s conviction is inconsistent with the statutory meaning of the term enterprise and serves to expand RICO liability far beyond the bounds Congress intended, I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RICO makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  \u00a71962(c).  The statute defines \u201centerprise\u201d to include \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d  \u00a71961(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is clear from the statute and our earlier decisions construing the term that Congress used \u201centerprise\u201d in these provisions in the sense of \u201ca business organization,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976), rather than \u201ca \u2018venture,\u2019 \u2018undertaking,\u2019 or \u2018project,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 6 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, at 757).  First, the terms \u201cindividual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity\u201d describe entities with formal legal structures most commonly established for business purposes.  \u00a71961(4).  In context, the subsequent reference to any \u201cunion or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity\u201d reflects an intended commonality between the legal and nonlegal entities included in the provision.  Ibid. (emphasis added). \u201cThe juxtaposition of the two phrases suggests that \u2018associated in fact\u2019 just means structured without the aid of legally defined structural forms such as the business corporation.\u201d  Limestone Development Corp. v. Lemont, 520 F.\u00a03d 797, 804\u2013805 (CA7 2008).[Footnote 1]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That an enterprise must have business-like characteristics is confirmed by the text of \u00a71962(c) and our decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170 (1993).  Section 1962(c) creates liability for \u201cconduct[ing] or participat[ing] \u2026 in the conduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  In Reves, we examined that provision\u2019s meaning and held that, \u201c[i]n order to \u2018participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs,\u2019 one must have some part in directing those affairs.\u201d  Id., at 179 (quoting \u00a71962(c)).  It is not enough for a defendant to \u201ccarry on\u201d or \u201cparticipate in\u201d an enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity; instead, evidence that he operated, managed, or directed those affairs is required.  See id., at 177\u2013179.  This requirement confirms that the enterprise element demands evidence of a certain quantum of business-like organization\u2014i.e., a system of processes, dealings, or other affairs that can be \u201cdirected.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases also make clear that an enterprise \u201cis an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.\u201d  United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 583 (1981).  As with the requirement that an enterprise have business-like characteristics, that an enterprise must have a separate existence is confirmed by \u00a71962(c) and Reves.  If an entity\u2019s existence consisted solely of its members\u2019 performance of a pattern of racketeering acts, the \u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d would be synonymous with the \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  Section 1962(c) would then prohibit an individual from conducting or participating in \u201cthe conduct of [a pattern of racketeering activity] through a pattern of racketeering activity\u201d\u2014a reading that is unbearably redundant, particularly in a case like this one in which a single pattern of activity is alleged.  The only way to avoid that result is to require that an \u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d be something other than the pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by its members.[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing an enterprise\u2019s business-like nature and its distinctness from the pattern of predicate acts, however, does not answer the question of what proof each element requires.  In cases involving a legal entity, the matter of proving the enterprise element is straightforward, as the entity\u2019s legal existence will always be something apart from the pattern of activity performed by the defendant or his associates.  Cf. Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U. S. 158, 163 (2001).  But in the case of an association-in-fact enterprise, the Government must adduce other evidence of the entity\u2019s \u201cseparate\u201d existence and \u201congoing organization.\u201d  Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583.  There may be cases in which a jury can infer that existence and continuity from the evidence used to establish the pattern of racketeering activity.  Ibid.  But that will be true only when the pattern of activity is so complex that it could not be performed in the absence of structures or processes for planning or concealing the illegal conduct beyond those inherent in performing the predicate acts.  More often, proof of an enterprise\u2019s separate existence will require different evidence from that used to establish the pattern of predicate acts.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Precisely what proof is required in each case is a more difficult question, largely due to the abundant variety of RICO predicates and enterprises.  Because covered enterprises are necessarily business-like in nature, however, proof of an association-in-fact enterprise\u2019s separate existence will generally require evidence of rules, routines, or processes through which the entity maintains its continuing operations and seeks to conceal its illegal acts.  As petitioner suggests, this requirement will usually be satisfied by evidence that the association has an \u201cascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Examples of such structure include an organizational hierarchy, a \u201cframework for making decisions,\u201d an \u201cinternal discipline mechanism,\u201d \u201cregular meetings,\u201d or a practice of \u201creinvest[ing] proceeds to promote and expand the enterprise.\u201d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 31\u201334.  In other cases, the enterprise\u2019s existence might be established through evidence that it provides goods or services to third parties, as such an undertaking will require organizational elements more comprehensive than those necessary to perform a pattern of predicate acts.  Thus, the evidence needed to establish an enterprise will vary from case to case, but in every case the Government must carry its burden of proving that an alleged enterprise has an existence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by its constituents.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In some respects, my reading of the statute is not very different from that adopted by the Court.  We agree that \u201can association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s purpose.\u201d  Ante, at 6.  But the Court stops short of giving content to that requirement.  It states only that RICO \u201cdemands proof that the enterprise had \u2018affairs\u2019 of sufficient duration to permit an associate to \u2018participate\u2019 in those affairs through \u2018a pattern of racketeering activity,\u2019\u00a0\u201d before concluding that \u201c[a] trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing the language of an instruction\u201d and need not use the term \u201cstructure.\u201d  Ante, at 7.\u00a0 While I agree the word structure is not talismanic, I would hold that the instructions must convey the requirement that the alleged enterprise have an existence apart from the alleged pattern of predicate acts.  The Court\u2019s decision, by contrast, will allow juries to infer the existence of an enterprise in every case involving a pattern of racketeering activity undertaken by two or more associates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By permitting the Government to prove both elements with the same evidence, the Court renders the enterprise requirement essentially meaningless in association-in-fact cases.  It also threatens to make that category of \u00a71962(c) offenses indistinguishable from conspiracies to commit predicate acts, see \u00a7371, as the only remaining difference is \u00a71962(c)\u2019s pattern requirement.  The Court resists this criticism, arguing that \u00a71962(c) \u201cdemands much more\u201d than the inchoate offense defined in \u00a7371.  Ante, at 10.  It states that the latter \u201cmay be completed in the brief period needed for the formation of the agreement and the commission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,\u201d whereas the former requires the creation of \u201ca group with a common purpose and course of conduct\u2014and the actual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.\u201d  Ibid.  Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to violate \u00a71962(c), see \u00a71962(d), this comment provides no assurance that RICO and \u00a7371 offenses remain distinct.  Only if proof of the enterprise element\u2014the \u201cgroup with a common purpose and course of conduct\u201d\u2014requires evidence of activity or organization beyond that inherent in the pattern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity distinct from \u00a7371 offenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case illustrates these concerns.  The trial judge instructed the jury that an enterprise need have only the degree of organization necessary \u201cfor carrying out its objectives\u201d and that it could \u201cfind an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts.\u201d  App. 112.[Footnote 3]  These instructions were plainly deficient, as they did not require the Government to prove that the alleged enterprise had an existence apart from the pattern of predicate acts.  Instead, they permitted the Government\u2019s proof of the enterprise\u2019s structure and continuing nature\u2014requirements on which all agree\u2014to consist only of evidence that petitioner and his associates performed a pattern of racketeering activity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner\u2019s requested instruction would have required the jury to find that the alleged enterprise \u201chad an ongoing organization, a core membership that functioned as a continuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d  Id., at 95.  That instruction does not precisely track my understanding of the statute; although evidence of \u201cstructural hierarchy\u201d can evidence an enterprise, it is not necessary to establish that element.  Nevertheless, the proposed instruction would have better directed the jury to consider whether the alleged enterprise possessed the separate existence necessary to expose petitioner to liability under \u00a71962(c), and the trial judge should have considered an instruction along those lines.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial judge also erred in finding the Government\u2019s evidence in this case sufficient to support petitioner\u2019s RICO convictions.  Petitioner was alleged to have participated and conspired to participate in the conduct of an enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of one act of bank robbery and three acts of interstate transportation of stolen funds.  Id., at 15\u201319.  The \u201cprimary goals\u201d of the alleged enterprise \u201cincluded generating money for its members and associates through the commission of criminal activity, including bank robberies, bank burglaries and interstate transportation of stolen money.\u201d  Id., at 14.  And its modus operandi was to congregate periodically when an associate had a lead on a night-deposit box that the group could break into.  Whoever among the associates was available would bring screwdrivers, crowbars, and walkie-talkies to the location.  Some acted as lookouts, while others retrieved the money.  When the endeavor was successful, the participants would split the proceeds.  Thus, the group\u2019s purpose and activities, and petitioner\u2019s participation therein, were limited to sporadic acts of taking money from bank deposit boxes.  There is no evidence in RICO\u2019s text or history that Congress intended it to reach such ad\u00a0hoc associations of thieves.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the instructions and evidence in this case did not satisfy the requirement that an alleged enterprise have an existence separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00a0To be sure, we have read RICO\u2019s enterprise term broadly to include entities with exclusively noneconomic motives or wholly unlawful purposes.  See National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 252 (1994) (NOW); United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 580\u2013581 (1981).  But those holdings are consistent with the conclusion that an enterprise is a business-like entity.  Indeed, the examples of qualifying associations cited in Turkette\u2014including loan-sharking, property-fencing, drug-trafficking, and counterfeiting operations\u2014satisfy that criterion, as each describes an organization with continuing operations directed toward providing goods or services to its customers.  See id., at 589\u2013590 (citing 84 Stat. 923; 116 Cong. Rec. 592 (1970)).  Similarly, the enterprise at issue in NOW was a nationwide network of antiabortion groups that had a leadership counsel and regular conferences and whose members undertook an extensive pattern of extortion, arson, and other racketeering activity for the purpose of \u201cshut[ting] down abortion clinics.\u201d  510 U. S., at 253.\n\u00a0The other subsections of 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71962 further demonstrate the business-like nature of the enterprise element and its necessary distinctness from the pattern of racketeering activity.  Subsection (a) prohibits anyone who receives income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity from \u201cus[ing] or invest[ing], directly or indirectly, any part of such income \u2026 in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise.\u201d  And subsection (b) prohibits anyone from \u201cacquir[ing] or maintain[ing]\u201d any interest in or control of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  We noted in NOW that the term enterprise \u201cplays a different role in the structure\u201d of those subsections than it does in subsection (c) because the enterprise in those subsections is the victim.  510 U. S., at 258\u2013259.  We did not, however, suggest that the term has a substantially different meaning in each subsection.  To the contrary, our observation that the enterprise in subsection (c) is \u201cthe vehicle through which the unlawful pattern of racketeering activity is committed,\u201d id., at 259, indicates that, as in subsections (a) and (b), the enterprise must have an existence apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.\n\u00a0For the full text of the relevant portion of the instructions, see ante, at 3, n.\u00a01."}, {"id": 1779, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962882, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/938/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1779", "justia_text": "BOYLE v.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a71962(c), was sufficient to prove, among other things, that Boyle and others committed a series of bank thefts in several States; that the participants included a core group, along with others recruited from time to time; and that the core group was loosely and informally organized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master plan.  Relying largely on United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 583, the District Court instructed the jury that to establish a RICO association-in-fact \u201centerprise,\u201d the Government must prove (1) an ongoing organization with a framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives, and (2) that association members functioned as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.  The court also told the jury that an association-in-fact\u2019s existence is often more readily proved by what it does than by abstract analysis of its structure, and denied Boyle\u2019s request for an instruction requiring the Government to prove that the enterprise had \u201can ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d  Boyle was convicted, and the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a \u201cstructure,\u201d but the pertinent jury instruction need not be framed in the precise language Boyle proposes, i.e., as having \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\u201d  Pp.\u00a04\u201312.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0In light of RICO\u2019s broad statement that an enterprise \u201cincludes any \u2026 group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,\u201d \u00a71961(4), and the requirement that RICO be \u201cliberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,\u201d note following \u00a71961, Turkette explained that \u201centerprise\u201d reaches \u201ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,\u201d 452 U. S., at 583, and \u201cis proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d  Ibid.  Pp.\u00a04\u20135. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The question presented by this case is whether an association-in-fact enterprise must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. i.  This question can be broken into three parts.  First, the enterprise must have a \u201cstructure\u201d that, under RICO\u2019s terms, has at least three features:\u00a0a purpose, relationships among the associates, and longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s purpose.  See Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583.  The instructions need not actually use the term \u201cstructure,\u201d however, so long as the relevant point\u2019s substance is adequately expressed.  Second, because a jury must find the existence of elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, requiring a jury to find the existence of a structure that is ascertainable would be redundant and potentially misleading.  Third, the phrase \u201cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\u201d is correctly interpreted to mean that the enterprise\u2019s existence is a separate element that must be proved, not that such existence may never be inferred from the evidence showing that the associates engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.  See ibid.  Pp.\u00a06\u20138. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Boyle\u2019s argument that an enterprise must have structural features additional to those that can be fairly inferred from RICO\u2019s language\u2014e.g., a hierarchical structure or chain of command; fixed roles for associates; and an enterprise name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies\u2014has no basis in the statute\u2019s text.  As Turkette said, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.  The breadth of RICO\u2019s \u201centerprise\u201d concept is highlighted by comparing the statute with other federal laws having much more stringent requirements for targeting organized criminal groups: E.g., \u00a71955(b) defines an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d as one that \u201cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\u201d  Pp.\u00a08\u201310. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0Rejection of Boyle\u2019s argument does not lead to a merger of the \u00a71962(c) crime and other federal offenses.  For example, proof that a defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessarily establish that he conspired to participate in a gambling enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  Rather, that would require the prosecution to prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \u00a71955 violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes.  See \u00a71961(1).  Pp.\u00a010\u201311.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0Because RICO\u2019s language is clear, the Court need not reach Boyle\u2019s statutory purpose, legislative history, or rule-of-lenity arguments.  Pp.\u00a011\u201312.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The instructions below were correct and adequate.  By explicitly telling jurors they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise, the instructions made clear that this was a separate element from the pattern of racketeering activity.  The jurors also were adequately told that the enterprise needed the structural attributes that may be inferred from the statutory language.  Finally, the instruction that an enterprise\u2019s existence \u201cis oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure\u201d properly conveyed Turkette\u2019s point that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit an inference of the enterprise\u2019s existence.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a71961 et seq., must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. i.  We hold that such an enterprise must have a \u201cstructure\u201d but that an instruction framed in this precise language is not necessary.  The District Court properly instructed the jury in this case.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nI\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The evidence at petitioner\u2019s trial was sufficient to prove the following: Petitioner and others participated in a series of bank thefts in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin during the 1990\u2019s.  The participants in these crimes included a core group, along with others who were recruited from time to time.  Although the participants sometimes attempted bank-vault burglaries and bank robberies, the group usually targeted cash-laden night-deposit boxes, which are often found in banks in retail areas. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each theft was typically carried out by a group of participants who met beforehand to plan the crime, gather tools (such as crowbars, fishing gaffs, and walkie-talkies), and assign the roles that each participant would play (such as lookout and driver).  The participants generally split the proceeds from the thefts.  The group was loosely and informally organized.  It does not appear to have had a leader or hierarchy; nor does it appear that the participants ever formulated any long-term master plan or agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From 1991 to 1994, the core group was responsible for more than 30 night-deposit-box thefts.  By 1994, petitioner had joined the group, and over the next five years, he participated in numerous attempted night-deposit-box thefts and at least two attempted bank-vault burglaries. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2003, petitioner was indicted for participation in the conduct of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71962(c); conspiracy to commit that offense, in violation of \u00a71962(d); conspiracy to commit bank burglary, in violation of \u00a7371; and nine counts of bank burglary and attempted bank burglary, in violation of \u00a72113(a).\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In instructing the jury on the meaning of a RICO \u201centerprise,\u201d the District Court relied largely on language in United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576 (1981).  The court told the jurors that, in order to establish the existence of such an enterprise, the Government had to prove that:  \u201c(1) There [was] an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2) the various members and associates of the association function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.\u201d  App. 112.  Over petitioner\u2019s objection, the court also told the jury that it could \u201cfind an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\u201d and that \u201c[c]ommon sense suggests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.\u201d  Id., at 111\u2013112.[Footnote 1]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner requested an instruction that the Government was required to prove that the enterprise \u201chad an ongoing organization, a core membership that functioned as a continuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d  Id., at 95.  The District Court refused to give that instruction. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner was convicted on 11 of the 12 counts against him, including the RICO counts, and was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.  In a summary order, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction but vacated the sentence on a ground not relevant to the issues before us.  283 Fed. Appx. 825 (2007).  The Court of Appeals did not specifically address the RICO jury instructions, stating only that the arguments not discussed in the order were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d  Id., at 826.  Petitioner was then resentenced, and we granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve conflicts among the Courts of Appeals concerning the meaning of a RICO enterprise. \nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RICO makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\u201d  18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71962(c) (emphasis added). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute does not specifically define the outer boundaries of the \u201centerprise\u201d concept but states that the term \u201cincludes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d  \u00a71961(4).[Footnote 2]  This enumeration of included enterprises is obviously broad, encompassing \u201cany \u2026 group of individuals associated in fact.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The term \u201cany\u201d ensures that the definition has a wide reach, see, e.g., Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 4\u20135), and the very concept of an association in fact is expansive.  In addition, the RICO statute provides that its terms are to be \u201cliberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d  \u00a7904(a), 84 Stat. 947, note following 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71961; see also, e.g., National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 257 (1994) (\u201cRICO broadly defines \u2018enterprise\u2019\u00a0\u201d); Sedima, S.\u00a0P.\u00a0R.\u00a0L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 497 (1985) (\u201cRICO is to be read broadly\u201d); Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 21 (1983) (noting \u201cthe pattern of the RICO statute in utilizing terms and concepts of breadth\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these statutory features, we explained in Turkette that \u201can enterprise includes any union or group of individuals associated in fact\u201d and that RICO reaches \u201ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d  452 U. S., at 580, 583.  Such an enterprise, we said, \u201cis proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d  Id., at 583. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding these precedents, the dissent asserts that the definition of a RICO enterprise is limited to \u201cbusiness-like entities.\u201d  See post, at 1\u20135 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  We see no basis to impose such an extratextual requirement.[Footnote 3]\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, the specific question on which we granted certiorari is whether an association-in-fact enterprise must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages.\u201d  Pet. for Cert. i.  We will break this question into three parts.  First, must an association-in-fact enterprise have a \u201cstructure\u201d?  Second, must the structure be \u201cascertainable\u201d?  Third, must the \u201cstructure\u201d go \u201cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\u201d in which its members engage? \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cStructure.\u201d  We agree with petitioner that an association-in-fact enterprise must have a structure.  In the sense relevant here, the term \u201cstructure\u201d means \u201c[t]he way in which parts are arranged or put together to form a whole\u201d and \u201c[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a complex entity.\u201d  American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed. 2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among other things, \u201cthe pattern of relationships, as of status or friendship, existing among the members of a group or society\u201d). \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s purpose.  As we succinctly put it in Turkette, an association-in-fact enterprise is \u201ca group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d  452 U. S., at 583.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That an \u201centerprise\u201d must have a purpose is apparent from meaning of the term in ordinary usage, i.e., a \u201cventure,\u201d \u201cundertaking,\u201d or \u201cproject.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976).  The concept of \u201cassociat[ion]\u201d requires both interpersonal relationships and a common interest.  See id., at 132 (defining \u201cassociation\u201d as \u201can organization of persons having a common interest\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining \u201cassociation\u201d as a \u201ccollection of persons who have joined together for a certain object\u201d).  Section 1962(c) reinforces this conclusion and also shows that an \u201centerprise\u201d must have some longevity, since the offense proscribed by that provision demands proof that the enterprise had \u201caffairs\u201d of sufficient duration to permit an associate to \u201cparticipate\u201d in those affairs through \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although an association-in-fact enterprise must have these structural features, it does not follow that a district court must use the term \u201cstructure\u201d in its jury instructions.  A trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing the language of an instruction so long as the substance of the relevant point is adequately expressed. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAscertainable.\u201d  Whenever a jury is told that it must find the existence of an element beyond a reasonable doubt, that element must be \u201cascertainable\u201d or else the jury could not find that it was proved.  Therefore, telling the members of the jury that they had to ascertain the existence of an \u201cascertainable structure\u201d would have been redundant and potentially misleading. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  This phrase may be interpreted in least two different ways, and its correctness depends on the particular sense in which the phrase is used.  If the phrase is interpreted to mean that the existence of an enterprise is a separate element that must be proved, it is of course correct.  As we explained in Turkette, the existence of an enterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of racketeering activity and \u201cproof of one does not necessarily establish the other.\u201d[Footnote 4]  452 U. S., at 583. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, if the phrase is used to mean that the existence of an enterprise may never be inferred from the evidence showing that persons associated with the enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, it is incorrect.  We recognized in Turkette that the evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise \u201cmay in particular cases coalesce.\u201d  Ibid.\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The crux of petitioner\u2019s argument is that a RICO enterprise must have structural features in addition to those that we think can be fairly inferred from the language of the statute.  Although petitioner concedes that an association-in-fact enterprise may be an \u201c\u00a0\u2018informal\u2019\u00a0\u201d group and that \u201cnot \u2018much\u2019\u00a0\u201d structure is needed, Reply Brief for Petitioner 24, he contends that such an enterprise must have at least some additional structural attributes, such as a structural \u201chierarchy,\u201d \u201crole differentiation,\u201d a \u201cunique modus operandi,\u201d a \u201cchain of command,\u201d \u201cprofessionalism and sophistication of organization,\u201d \u201cdiversity and complexity of crimes,\u201d \u201cmembership dues, rules and regulations,\u201d \u201cuncharged or additional crimes aside from predicate acts,\u201d an \u201cinternal discipline mechanism,\u201d \u201cregular meetings regarding enterprise affairs,\u201d an \u201centerprise \u2018name,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and \u201cinduction or initiation ceremonies and rituals.\u201d  Id., at 31\u201335; see also Brief for Petitioner 26\u201328, 33; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 8, 17. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see no basis in the language of RICO for the structural requirements that petitioner asks us to recognize.  As we said in Turkette, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.  Such a group need not have a hierarchical structure or a \u201cchain of command\u201d; decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis and by any number of methods\u2014by majority vote, consensus, a show of strength, etc.  Members of the group need not have fixed roles; different members may perform different roles at different times.  The group need not have a name, regular meetings, dues, established rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction or initiation ceremonies.  While the group must function as a continuing unit and remain in existence long enough to pursue a course of conduct, nothing in RICO exempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts of activity punctuated by periods of quiescence.  Nor is the statute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated, diverse, complex, or unique; for example, a group that does nothing but engage in extortion through old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and brutal means may fall squarely within the statute\u2019s reach. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The breadth of the \u201centerprise\u201d concept in RICO is highlighted by comparing the statute with other federal statutes that target organized criminal groups.  For example, 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71955(b), which was enacted together with RICO as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 922, defines an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d as one that \u201cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business.\u201d  A \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise,\u201d as defined in 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7848(c), must involve more than five persons who act in concert and must have an \u201corganizer,\u201d supervisor, or other manager.  Congress included no such requirements in RICO.  \nIII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to petitioner\u2019s claims, rejection of his argument regarding these structural characteristics does not lead to a merger of the crime proscribed by 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71962(c) (participating in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity) and any of the following offenses: operating a gambling business, \u00a71955; conspiring to commit one or more crimes that are listed as RICO predicate offenses, \u00a7371; or conspiring to violate the RICO statute, \u00a71962(d). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proof that a defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessarily establish that the defendant conspired to participate in the affairs of a gambling enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  In order to prove the latter offense, the prosecution must prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \u00a71955 violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes.  See \u00a71961(1).  No such proof is needed to establish a simple violation of \u00a71955.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, proof that a defendant conspired to commit a RICO predicate offense\u2014for example, arson\u2014does not necessarily establish that the defendant participated in the affairs of an arson enterprise through a pattern of arson crimes.  Under \u00a7371, a conspiracy is an inchoate crime that may be completed in the brief period needed for the formation of the agreement and the commission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  See United States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671, 694 (1975).  Section 1962(c) demands much more: the creation of an \u201centerprise\u201d\u2014a group with a common purpose and course of conduct\u2014and the actual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.[Footnote 5] \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, while in practice the elements of a violation of \u00a7\u00a71962(c) and (d) are similar, this overlap would persist even if petitioner\u2019s conception of an association-in-fact enterprise were accepted.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the statutory language is clear, there is no need to reach petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments based on statutory purpose, legislative history, or the rule of lenity.  In prior cases, we have rejected similar arguments in favor of the clear but expansive text of the statute.  See National Organization for Women, 510 U. S., at 262 (\u201cThe fact that RICO has been applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.  It demonstrates breadth\u201d (quoting Sedima, 473 U. S., at 499, brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Turkette, 452 U. S., at 589\u2013591.  \u201cWe have repeatedly refused to adopt narrowing constructions of RICO in order to make it conform to a preconceived notion of what Congress intended to proscribe.\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 20); see also, e.g., National Organization for Women, supra, at 252 (rejecting the argument that \u201cRICO requires proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were motivated by an economic purpose\u201d); H.\u00a0J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 244 (1989) (declining to read \u201can organized crime limitation into RICO\u2019s pattern concept\u201d); Sedima, supra, at 481 (rejecting the view that RICO provides a private right of action \u201conly against defendants who had been convicted on criminal charges, and only where there had occurred a \u2018racketeering injury\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The instructions the District Court judge gave to the jury in this case were correct and adequate.  These instructions explicitly told the jurors that they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise.  See App. 111.  The instructions made clear that this was a separate element from the pattern of racketeering activity.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The instructions also adequately told the jury that the enterprise needed to have the structural attributes that may be inferred from the statutory language.  As noted, the trial judge told the jury that the Government was required to prove that there was \u201can ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives\u201d and that \u201cthe various members and associates of the association function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose.\u201d  Id., at 112.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the trial judge did not err in instructing the jury that \u201cthe existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.\u201d  Id., at 111\u2013112.  This instruction properly conveyed the point we made in Turkette that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity may be sufficient in a particular case to permit a jury to infer the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0The relevant portion of the instructions was as follows: \n\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018enterprise\u2019 as used in these instructions may also include a group of people associated in fact, even though this association is not recognized as a legal entity.  Indeed, an enterprise need not have a name.  Thus, an enterprise need not be a form[al] business entity such as a corporation, but may be merely an informal association of individuals.  A group or association of people can be an \u2018enterprise\u2019 if, among other requirements, these individuals \u2018associate\u2019 together for a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.  Common sense sug-\ngests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, you may find an enterprise where an association of individuals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts.  Such an association of persons may be established by evidence showing an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and . . . by evidence that the people making up the association functioned as a continuing unit.  Therefore, in order to establish the existence of such an enterprise, the government must prove that: (1) There is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2) the various members and associates of the association function as a continuing unit to achieve a common purpose. \n\n\n\u201cRegarding \u2018organization,\u2019 it is not necessary that the enterprise have any particular or formal structure, but it must have sufficient organization that its members functioned and operated in a coordinated manner in order to carry out the alleged common purpose or purposes of the enterprise.\u201d  App. 111\u2013113 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0This provision does not purport to set out an exhaustive definition of the term \u201centerprise.\u201d  Compare \u00a7\u00a71961(1)\u2013(2) (defining what the terms \u201cracketeering activity\u201d and \u201cState\u201d mean) with \u00a7\u00a71961(3)\u2013(4) (defining what the terms \u201cperson\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d include).  Accordingly, this provision does not foreclose the possibility that the term might include, in addition to the specifically enumerated entities, others that fall within the ordinary meaning of the term \u201centerprise.\u201d  See H.\u00a0J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 238 (1989) (explaining that the term \u201cpattern\u201d also retains its ordinary meaning notwithstanding the statutory definition in \u00a71961(5)).\n\u00a0The dissent claims that the \u201cbusiness-like\u201d limitation \u201cis confirmed by the text of \u00a71962(c) and our decision in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170 (1993).\u201d  Post, at 3.  Section 1962(c), however, states only that one may not \u201cconduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d  Whatever business-like characteristics the dissent has in mind, we do not see them in \u00a71962(c).  Furthermore, Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170 (1993), is inapposite because that case turned on our interpretation of the participation requirement of \u00a71962, not the definition of \u201centerprise.\u201d  See id., at 184\u2013185.  In any case, it would be an interpretive stretch to deduce from the requirement that an enterprise must be \u201cdirected\u201d to impose the much broader, amorphous requirement that it be \u201cbusiness-like.\u201d\n\u00a0It is easy to envision situations in which proof that individuals engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity would not establish the existence of an enterprise.  For example, suppose that several individuals, independently and without coordination, engaged in a pattern of crimes listed as RICO predicates\u2014for example, bribery or extortion.  Proof of these patterns would not be enough to show that the individuals were members of an enterprise.\n\u00a0The dissent states that \u201c[o]nly if proof of the enterprise element\u00a0\u2026\u00a0requires evidence of activity or organization beyond that inherent in the pattern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity distinct from \u00a7371 offenses.\u201d  Post, at 7 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  This is incorrect:  Even if the same evidence may prove two separate elements, this does not mean that the two elements collapse into one."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/938/"}, {"ID": 55595, "name": "Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v.

In his appeals to the Ohio Court of Appeals and Supreme Court of Ohio, Mr. Bies argued that he was mentally retarded and this fact should mitigate his sentence. Both courts affirmed his conviction and sentence, but agreed that he was mentally retarded. While Mr. Bies proceeded with his post-conviction appeals, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Atkins</em> stating that \"death is not a suitable punishment for mentally retarded people.\" He subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in an Ohio federal district court relying on <em>Atkins</em>. In response, the state claimed that Mr. Bies was not mentally retarded. Mr. Bies argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the state from relitigating the fact of his mental retardation. The district court agreed and granted Mr. Bies' petition for habeas corpus relief and ordered that he be resentenced.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. It held that the state was prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause from relitigating the Supreme Court of Ohio's determination that Mr. Bies was mentally retarded.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit err when it applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent the relitigation of the Mr. Bies's mental retardation even though the Supreme Court of Ohio did not actually determine the issue on appeal?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, it held that the Ohio courts were not precluded by the Double Jeopardy Clause from conducting a rehearing with respect to Mr. Bies' mental retardation. The Court reasoned that Ohio did not twice put Mr. Bies in jeopardy of conviction because he was never acquitted at trial. Rather, the Court stated that the Ohio courts merely attempted to discern the nature of Mr. Bies mental capacities in order determine whether his death sentence should be mitigated when weighed against other factors.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 17897, "name": "Benjamin C.

BIES\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\nNo. 08\u2013598.\u2003Argued April 27, 2009\u2014Decided June 1, 2009\nIn Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Prior to Atkins, mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty.  See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Nearly a decade before Atkins, respondent Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy.  Instructed at the sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evidence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggravating factors (including the crime\u2019s brutality), the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.  Ohio\u2019s Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, each concluding that Bies\u2019 mental retardation was entitled to \u201csome weight\u201d as a mitigating factor, but that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.  Bies then filed an unsuccessful petition for state postconviction relief, contending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of a mentally retarded defendant.  Soon after Bies sought federal habeas relief, this Court decided Atkins.  The opinion left to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to determine when a person claiming mental retardation would fall within Atkins\u2019 compass.  Ohio heeded Atkins\u2019 call in State v. Lott.  The District Court then stayed Bies\u2019 federal habeas proceedings so that he could present an Atkins claim to the state postconviction court.  Observing that Bies\u2019 mental retardation had not previously been established under the Atkins-Lott framework, the state court denied Bies\u2019 motion for summary judgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim.  Rather than proceeding with that hearing, Bies returned to federal court, arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from relitigating the mental retardation issue.  The District Court granted the habeas petition, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, the Court of Appeals determined that all requirements for the issue preclusion component of the Double Jeopardy Clause were met in Bies\u2019 case.  It concluded, inter alia, that the Ohio Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had decided the mental retardation issue under the same standard that court later adopted in Lott, and that the state court\u2019s recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state had been necessary to the death penalty judgment.  When the Sixth Circuit denied the State\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, a concurring judge offered an alternative basis for decision.  He opined that, under Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, jeopardy attaches once a capital defendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d based on findings establishing an entitlement to a life sentence; reasoning that the Ohio courts\u2019 mental retardation findings entitled Bies to a life sentence, he concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred any renewed inquiry into Bies\u2019 mental state.\nHeld:\u00a0The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Ohio courts from conducting a full hearing on Bies\u2019 mental capacity.  Pp.\u00a07\u201311.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The alternative basis for decision offered by the concurring opinion at the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rehearing stage is rejected.  The State did not \u201ctwice put [Bies] in jeopardy,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitutional sense.  Sattazahn offers Bies no aid, for there was no acquittal here.  Bies\u2019 jury voted to impose the death penalty.  At issue is his attempt to vacate that sentence, not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase his punishment.  Nor did the state courts\u2019 mental retardation determinations entitle Bies to a life sentence.  At the time of his sentencing and direct appeal, Penry, not Atkins, was the guiding decision, and the dispositive issue was whether the mitigating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.\u00a07\u20138.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The issue preclusion doctrine, on which the Sixth Circuit panel primarily relied, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins and Lott.  The doctrine bars relitigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.  Initially, it is not clear that the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation was actually determined under the Lott test at trial or on direct appeal.  Nor did the State concede that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott, which had not then been decided.  More fundamental, it is clear that the state courts\u2019 statements regarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the judgments affirming his death sentence.  Instead, those determinations cut against the ultimate outcome.  In holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit conflated a determination necessary to the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not outcome determinative.  The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on Ashe\u2019s statement: \u201c[W]hen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d  397 U. S., at 443.  Bies\u2019 case does not involve the kind of \u201cultimate fact\u201d addressed in Ashe.  There, the State was precluded from trying Ashe for robbing a poker player because he had already been acquitted of robbing a different player in the same poker game, and the acquittal was based on a determination that Ashe was not a participant in the poker game robbery.  Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted, and determinations of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.  Moreover, even if the core issue preclusion requirements had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s application would be warranted due to the intervening Atkins decision.  Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation under Atkins and Lott are discrete legal issues.  One difference is that mental retardation, urged as a mitigating factor, may instead \u201cenhance the likelihood that [a jury will find] the aggravating factor of future dangerousness.\u201d  Atkins 536 U. S., at 521.  This reality explains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little incentive to contest retardation evidence.  Because the change in law substantially altered the State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity, applying preclusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.  The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed the state-court proceeding.  Recourse first to Ohio\u2019s courts is what this Court envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing Atkins.  The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under the Atkins and Lott precedents.

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), this Court held that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Prior to Atkins, the Court had determined that mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty.  See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1992, nearly a decade before the Court\u2019s decision in Atkins, respondent Michael Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy.  Instructed at the sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evidence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggravating factors (including the brutality of the crime), the jury recommended a sentence of death, which the trial court imposed.  Ohio\u2019s appellate courts affirmed the conviction and sentence.  The Ohio Supreme Court, in its 1996 opinion on direct review, observed that Bies\u2019 \u201cmild to borderline mental retardation merit[ed] some weight in mitigation,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  State v. Bies, 74 Ohio St. 3d 320, 328, 658 N.\u00a0E. 2d 754, 761\u2013762.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After this Court decided Atkins, the Ohio trial court ordered a full hearing on the question of Bies\u2019 mental capacity.  The federal courts intervened, however, granting habeas relief to Bies, and ordering the vacation of his death sentence.  Affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Ohio Supreme Court, in 1996, had definitively determined, as a matter of fact, Bies\u2019 mental retardation.  That finding, the Court of Appeals concluded, established Bies\u2019 \u201clegal entitlement to a life sentence.\u201d  Bies v. Bagley, 519 F.\u00a03d 324, 334, n.\u00a06 (CA6 2008).  Therefore, the Sixth Circuit ruled, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution barred any renewed inquiry into the matter of Bies\u2019 mental state.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Sixth Circuit, in common with the District Court, fundamentally misperceived the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause and its issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) component.[Footnote 1]  First, Bies was not \u201ctwice put in jeopardy.\u201d  He was sentenced to death, and Ohio sought no further prosecution or punishment.  Instead of \u201cserial prosecutions by the government[,] this case involves serial efforts by the defendant to vacate his capital sentence.\u201d  Bies v. Bagley, 535 F.\u00a03d 520, 531\u2013532 (CA6 2008) (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, mental retardation for purposes of Atkins, and mental retardation as one mitigator to be weighed against aggravators, are discrete issues.  Most grave among the Sixth Circuit\u2019s misunderstandings, issue preclusion is a plea available to prevailing parties.  The doctrine bars relitigation of determinations necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.  The Ohio courts\u2019 recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state as a mitigating factor was hardly essential to the death sentence he received.  On the contrary, the retardation evidence cut against the final judgment.  Issue preclusion, in short, does not transform final judgment losers, in civil or criminal proceedings, into partially prevailing parties.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For his part in brutally causing the death of a ten-year-old boy, Bies was convicted by an Ohio jury of attempted rape, kidnaping, and aggravated murder with three death penalty specifications.  App. 85; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.04(A)(3), (7) (Lexis 2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At sentencing, Bies presented testimony from clinical psychiatrist Donna E. Winter, who had evaluated him at the court\u2019s order during the guilt phase and again before the mitigation hearing.  App. 191, 202.  Bies did not qualify for a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, Dr. Winter concluded, because he knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of the offense.  Id., at 36, 51, 198\u2013200.  Bies\u2019 IQ, she further reported, fell in the 65\u201375 range, id., at 211\u2013212, indicating that he is \u201cmildly mentally retarded to borderline mentally retarded,\u201d id., at 20\u201321, 32, 199\u2013200, 213.  Dr. Winter also observed: \u201c[Bies] goes about the community, unassisted [and] carries out the activities of daily life fairly independently.\u201d  Id., at 199.  The State responded to Bies\u2019 mitigating evidence by emphasizing the brutality of the murder and the risk of Bies\u2019 future dangerousness.  Instructed to weigh the mitigating circumstances against aggravating factors, the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.  Id., at 88\u201389.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ohio Court of Appeals and Supreme Court each independently reviewed the evidence and affirmed.  Id., at 84\u2013108; Bies, 74 Ohio St. 3d 320, 658 N.\u00a0E. 2d 754.  Neither court devoted detailed attention to the issue of retardation.  Both concluded that Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retardation merited \u201csome weight\u201d in mitigation, as did his youth and lack of a criminal record.  App. 105\u2013106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 762.  The aggravating circumstances, each court found, overwhelmed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.  App. 106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 762.  We denied Bies\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari.  Bies v. Ohio, 517 U. S. 1238 (1996).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bies then filed a petition for state postconviction relief, contending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibits execution of a mentally retarded defendant.  The trial court agreed that Bies was \u201cmildly mentally retarded,\u201d but concluded that, under then-governing Ohio precedent, \u201ca mildly mentally retarded defendant may be [p]unished by execution.\u201d  App. 153.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, id., at 175\u2013176, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed Bies\u2019 appeal without an opinion, State v. Bies, 87 Ohio St. 3d 1440, 719 N.\u00a0E. 2d 4 (1999) (Table).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bies next filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Soon after that filing, this Court held, in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S., at 321, that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of mentally retarded offenders.  Our opinion did not provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation \u201cwill be so impaired as to fall [within Atkins\u2019 compass].\u201d  We \u201c\u00a0le[ft] to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.\u201d  Id., at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ohio heeded Atkins\u2019 call six months later in State v. Lott, 97 Ohio St. 3d 303, 2002\u2013Ohio\u20136625, 779 N. E. 2d 1011 (per curiam).  At an Atkins hearing, the Ohio Supreme Court held, a defendant must prove: \u201c(1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18.\u201d  97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 1014.  \u201cIQ tests,\u201d the court stated, \u201care one of the many factors that need to be considered, [but] they alone are not sufficient to make a final determination [of retardation].\u201d  Ibid.  The court also announced \u201ca rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court stayed its proceedings on Bies\u2019 federal habeas petition while Bies presented an Atkins claim to the state postconviction court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a.  Bies there moved for summary judgment, arguing that the record established his mental retardation, and that the State was \u201cprecluded and estopped\u201d from disputing it.  Id., at 104a.  The state court recognized that Atkins and Lott had materially changed the significance of a mental retardation finding.  The court observed that mental retardation had not previously been established under the Atkins-Lott framework; given those precedent-setting decisions, the court concluded, \u201cthere is a serious issue as to Mr. Bies\u2019 mental status.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 104a. Accordingly, the court denied summary judgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than proceeding with the hearing directed by the state court, Bies returned to the Federal District Court.  He argued that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, barred the State from relitigating the issue of his mental condition.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a.  The District Court granted the habeas petition and ordered vacation of Bies\u2019 death sentence.  Id., at 68a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  519 F.\u00a03d 324, 342.  It concluded that Bies\u2019 case was \u201ccontrolled by\u201d Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), which held that the doctrine of issue preclusion \u201cis embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d  519 F.\u00a03d, at 332 (quoting 397 U. S., at 445).  The Court of Appeals found all requirements for issue preclusion met in Bies\u2019 case.  It concluded, inter alia, that the Ohio Supreme Court, in resolving Bies\u2019 direct appeal, had decided the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation under the same standard later adopted in Lott.  519 F.\u00a03d, at 336.  Further, the Court of Appeals held, the state court\u2019s recognition that Bies qualified as mentally retarded had been necessary to the judgment imposing the death sentence. \u201c[D]etermining which mitigating factors are actually present,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cis a necessary first step to determining whether those factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d  Id., at 337.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals denied the State\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc.  535 F.\u00a03d 520.  Judge Clay, concurring, opined that Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101 (2003), provided an additional, independent basis for affirmance.  535 F.\u00a03d, at 523\u2013524.  Under that decision, he noted, jeopardy attaches, and relitigation is precluded, once a judge or jury has \u201cacquitted\u201d a capital defendant \u201cby entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to [a] life sentence.\u201d  Id., at 522 (quoting Sattazahn, 537 U. S., at 108\u2013109).  In Bies\u2019 case, Judge Clay concluded, the Ohio courts\u2019 determination of mental retardation \u201centitle[d]\u201d Bies to a life sentence, and thus the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from disputing the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation.  535 F.\u00a03d, at 523\u2013524.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Sutton dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc.  Sattazahn was inapposite, he maintained, because Bies was never \u201ctwice put in jeopardy.\u201d  535 F.\u00a03d, at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor, in Judge Sutton\u2019s view, did Ashe support the panel\u2019s decision, for issue preclusion did not come into play in Bies\u2019 case.  535 F.\u00a03d, at 532.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now reverse.\nII\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The alternative basis for decision offered at the rehearing stage in the Court of Appeals can be rejected without extensive explanation.  The State did not \u201ctwice put [Bies] in jeopardy,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitutional sense.  \u201c[T]he touchstone for double-jeopardy protection in capital-sentencing proceedings is whether there has been an \u2018acquittal.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Sattazahn, 537 U. S., at 109.  Sattazahn offers Bies no aid.  In that case, the defendant\u2019s first capital jury had deadlocked at the penalty phase, and the court, as required by state law, entered a life sentence.  Id., at 104\u2013105. This Court held the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the State\u2019s request for the death penalty at the defendant\u2019s retrial, noting that \u201cneither the judge nor the jury had acquitted the defendant in his first \u2026 proceeding by entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence.\u201d  Id., at 108\u2013109 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, as in Sattazahn, there was no acquittal.  Bies\u2019 jury voted to impose the death penalty.  At issue now is Bies\u2019 \u201csecond run at vacating his death sentence,\u201d 535 F.\u00a03d, at 531 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc), not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase his punishment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor did any state-court determination of Bies\u2019 mental retardation \u201centitl[e]\u201d him to a life sentence.  Cf. id., at 523 (Clay, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  At the time Bies was sentenced and on direct appeal, Penry, not Atkins, was this Court\u2019s guiding decision.  Under Penry, no single mitigator or aggravator was determinative of the judgment.  Instead, the dispositive issue, correctly comprehended by the Ohio courts, was whether \u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  Bies, 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 762.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals panel relied primarily on the doctrine of issue preclusion, recognized in Ashe to be \u201cembodied in\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause.  397 U. S., at 445.  Preclusion doctrine, however, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins and Lott.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of \u201can issue of fact or law\u201d that \u201cis actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and \u2026 is essential to the judgment.\u201d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a727 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement).  If a judgment does not depend on a given determination, relitigation of that determination is not precluded.  Id., \u00a727, Comment h.  In addition, even where the core requirements of issue preclusion are met, an exception to the general rule may apply when a \u201cchange in [the] applicable legal context\u201d intervenes.  Id., \u00a728, Comment c.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, it is not clear from the spare statements of the Ohio appellate courts that the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation under the Lott test was actually determined at trial or during Bies\u2019 direct appeal.  No court found, for example, that Bies suffered \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills.\u201d  Lott, 97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779 N. E. 2d, at 1014.  Nor did the State concede that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott, which had not then been decided.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More fundamental, it is clear that the courts\u2019 statements regarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the judgments affirming his death sentence.  A determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.  See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74421, p. 543 (2d ed. 2002).  \u201cFar from being necessary to the judgment, the Ohio courts\u2019 mental&nbhyph;retardation findings cut against it\u2014making them quintessentially the kinds of rulings not eligible for issue-preclusion treatment.\u201d  535 F.\u00a03d, at 533 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In finding the state court\u2019s determination \u201cnecessary to [the] judgment,\u201d 519 F.\u00a03d, at 342, the Court of Appeals panel reasoned that the Ohio courts determined Bies\u2019 mental capacity pursuant to their \u201cmandatory duty\u201d to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  Id., at 338. \u201c[W]eighing [aggravators against mitigators],\u201d the panel explained, \u201ccould not have occurred unless the court first determined what to place on either side of the scale.\u201d  Ibid.  This reasoning conflates a determination necessary to the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not outcome determinative.  Issue preclusion cannot transform Bies\u2019 loss at the sentencing phase into a partial victory.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the same reason, the Court of Appeals erred in its repeated reliance on the following passage in Ashe: \u201cWhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d  519 F.\u00a03d, at 331\u2013333 (quoting 397 U. S., at 443).   Bies\u2019 case does not involve an \u201cultimate fact\u201d of the kind our decision in Ashe addressed. There, the State sought to try Ashe for robbing a poker player even though a jury had already acquitted him of robbing a different player in the same poker game.  The State\u2019s second attempt was precluded, we held, because the first jury had based its verdict of acquittal upon a determination that Ashe was not one of the participants in the poker game robbery.  Id., at 445.  Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted\u2014and, as already observed, determinations of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, even if the core requirements for issue preclusion had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s application would be warranted due to this Court\u2019s intervening decision in Atkins.  Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation under Atkins and Lott are discrete legal issues.  The Atkins decision itself highlights one difference: \u201c[R]eliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.\u201d  536 U. S., at 321.  This reality explains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little incentive vigorously to contest evidence of retardation.  See App. 65 (excerpt from prosecutor\u2019s closing argument describing as Bies\u2019 \u201c[c]hief characteristic\u201d his \u201csensitivity to any kind of frustration and his rapid tendency to get enraged\u201d); id., at 39\u201354 (cross-examination of Bies\u2019 expert witness designed to emphasize Bies\u2019 dangerousness to others).  Because the change in law substantially altered the State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity, applying preclusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.  See Restatement \u00a728, Comment c.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed a state trial court proceeding \u201cdesigned to determine whether Bies ha[s] a successful Atkins claim.\u201d  535 F.\u00a03d, at 534 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Recourse first to Ohio\u2019s courts is just what this Court envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing the Atkins decision.  The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but it rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under the postsentencing precedents set in Atkins and Lott.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u201c[R]eplac[ing] a more confusing lexicon,\u201d the term \u201cissue preclusion,\u201d in current usage, \u201cencompasses the doctrines [earlier called] \u2018collateral estoppel\u2019 and \u2018direct estoppel.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5 (2008) (slip op., at 9, n.\u00a05).\n\u00a0This case, we note, is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.  Bies plainly fails to qualify for relief under that Act: The Ohio courts\u2019 decisions were not \u201ccontrary to, or \u2026 an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and were not \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2).

The claims, brought by environmental groups and corporations, allege that the EPA's cost/benefit analysis violated the Clean Water Act (CWA) by leading to the use of structures that were insufficient to protect aquatic organisms from being harmed or killed as required by the CWA.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1326(b), authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to compare costs with benefits in determining the \"best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact\" at cooling water intake structures?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that the EPA was permitted to use a cost-benefit analysis in setting national performance standards for cooling water intake structures. With Justice Antonin G. Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that under 33 U.S.C. 1326(b), the EPA has discretion to determine the extent of adverse environmental impact that should be reduced in setting national performance standards for cooling water intake structures. With this discretion, comes the authority to use a cost-benefit analysis in setting national performance standards.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed with the majority that the EPA was authorized to use a cost-benefit analysis in making its determinations. However, he noted that the drafting and legislative history of 33 U.S.C. Section 1326(b) indicate it was intended to restrict the use of cost-benefit analysis and consequently he found the EPA's reasoning deficient in employing its cost-benefit analysis. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented and was joined by Justices David H. Souter and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He argued that the plain language of the relevant statute indicates that the EPA was required to set a standard that cooling water intake systems use the \"best technology available\" and therefore impermissibly used a cost-benefit analysis in setting the new standard.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 21060, "name": "Daryl Joseffer", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/daryl_joseffer", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Joseffer", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "daryl_joseffer"}, "advocate_description": "Deputy Solicitor General, Department of Justice, argued the cause for the EPA, supporting the petitioners", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19811"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 36325, "name": "Maureen E.

The jury found that Cone had bludgeoned two elderly people to death while hiding out after a robbery. Cone's initial appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court soon following his conviction fell on deaf ears: the court ruled that although errors had been committed during the trial, each of them had been \"harmless\" and did not warrant overturning Cone's conviction. He responded by twice filing habeas corpus petitions alleging violations of several constitutional rights, appealing both all the way up to the Court but both times having his case remanded with, in his view, several of his claims still unresolved.</p>\n<p>In his third appearance before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Cone raised two main points of contention. First, he claimed that he was entitled to relief because the jury in his trial had weighed invalid aggravating factors during his sentencing hearing, thereby entitling him to a new hearing. This argument was rejected by the Sixth Circuit, which found that the Tennessee Supreme Court had conducted a satisfactory harmless error test on the issue. The court pointed out that habeas petitions should be granted only after finding that a state court ruling has \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\" Because Tennessee had not abridged any federal laws, the Sixth Circuit denied Cone relief on this first issue.</p>\n<p>Cone also argued that the Sixth Circuit had erred when, in a previous appeal, it had held that his claims relating to the prosecutor's improper withholding of evidence had been procedurally defaulted. Cone argued that his case met the Court's \"exceptional circumstances\" test as set out in <em>Westside Mothers v. Olszewski</em> for overruling the procedural default rule and rehearing the issue. The Sixth Circuit once again disagreed, ruling that Cone had failed to show \"cause and prejudice\" on the part of the prosecutor. The Sixth Circuit denied Cone's habeas appeal on all counts.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Is Mr. Cone entitled to federal habeas review of his claim that the state suppressed material evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>?</p>\n<p>2) Is Mr. Cone's federal habeas corpus claim \"procedurally defaulted\" because it has been presented twice at the state court level?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes and No. The Supreme Court held that the Tennessee state courts' rejection of Mr. Cone's <em>Brady</em> claim, that the state had suppressed material evidence at his trial, was improperly denied review during post-conviction proceedings and had not been procedurally defaulted. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court reasoned that Mr. Cone's <em>Brady</em> claim had in fact never been presented at the state court level and thus the Sixth Circuit erred in finding that Mr. Cone's claim had been defaulted for having been raised twice previously. Moreover, the Court reasoned that the documents withheld at Mr. Cone's trial were material to his sentencing and thus entitled him to federal habeas corpus review.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts wrote separately, concurring in the judgment. Justice Samuel A. Alito also wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part. He agreed that Mr. Cone's case was properly remanded for further review. However, he disagreed that Mr. Cone properly preserved and exhausted his <em>Brady</em> claim at the state court level because Mr. Cone never raised that claim at the state court level. Rather, he argued Mr. Cone's claim was either \"not exhausted\" or was \"procedurally defaulted\", appropriate for the Sixth Circuit to review, not the federal district court. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Antonin G. Scalia, dissented. He argued that Mr. Cone failed to prove that there was a \"reasonable probability\" that had the withheld evidence been disclosed at trial that his sentencing would have been different, and therefore his claim should not be granted federal habeas corpus review.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 42731, "name": "Thomas C.

At his trial, the prosecution submitted as evidence a letter of apology he wrote to the victim's wife. Montejo wrote the letter at the suggestion of a detective who accompanied him in a search for the murder weapon. Before the search, Mr. Montejo was read his Miranda rights and wrote an explanation for his participation in the search. However, no one in the search party knew, including Mr. Montejo, that he had been appointed an attorney the same morning. Mr. Montejo contended under these circumstances that the Sixth Amendment barred the introduction of this evidence since his attorney was not present when he wrote and submitted the letter of apology.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of Louisiana held that the letter of apology Mr. Montejo wrote was valid evidence. It found that Mr. Montejo waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It explained that when counsel was appointed Mr. Montejo remained mute and did not acknowledge it. The court reasoned that something beyond \"mute acquiescence\" is required to trigger the protections of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n", "question": "<p>After the appointment of an attorney, does a defendant need to take additional steps to accept the appointment in order to secure the protections afforded by the Sixth Amendment?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Not necessarily. The Supreme Court overruled its prior decision in Michigan v. Jackson which held that evidence obtained through interrogation after the defendant has invoked his right to counsel was inadmissible. With Justice Antonin G. Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court reasoned that the Jackson framework was unworkable in jurisdictions that appoint counsel regardless of a defendant's request. Instead, the Court stated that the protections afforded under Miranda, Edwards, and Minnick were sufficient to protect a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights from police badgering that might elicit culpable evidence.</p>\n<p>Justice Alito, joined by Justice Kennedy, also filed a concurring opinion. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented and was joined by Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and in part by Justice Stephen G. Breyer. He argued that the majority correctly concluded that the Louisiana Supreme Court misapplied the Court's holding in Jackson, but disagreed that the Court should have overruled its precedent entirely. Rather, Justice Stevens criticized the Court for misinterpreting the rationale of Jackson and undervaluing the role of stare decisis in its decision making. Justice Breyer also wrote a dissenting opinion, highlighting the consistency of his reasoning with respect to stare decisis in several other cases.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 21656, "name": "Donald B.

Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009), the Court overruled New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), even though that case had been on the books for 28 years, had not been undermined by subsequent decisions, had been recently reaffirmed and extended, had proven to be eminently workable (indeed, had been adopted for precisely that reason), and had engendered substantial law enforcement reliance.  See Gant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (Alito, J., dissenting).  The Court took this step even though we were not asked to overrule Belton and this new rule is almost certain to lead to a host of problems.  See Gant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (Alito, J., dissenting); Megginson v. United States, post, p. ___; Grooms v. United States, post, p. ___.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Scalia, who cast the deciding vote to overrule Belton, dismissed stare decisis concerns with the following observation: \u201c[I]t seems to me ample reason that the precedent was badly reasoned and produces erroneous \u2026 results.\u201d  Gant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3) (concurring opinion).  This narrow view of stare decisis provides\nthe only principle on which the decision in Gant can be justified.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of Gant, the discussion of stare decisis in today\u2019s dissent* is surprising.  The dissent in the case at hand criticizes the Court for \u201c[a]cting on its own\u201d in reconsidering Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986).  Post, at 4 (opinion of Stevens,\u00a0J.).  But the same was true in Gant, and in this case, the Court gave the parties and interested amici the opportunity to submit supplemental briefs on the issue, a step not taken in Gant.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent faults the Court for \u201ccast[ing] aside the reliance interests of law enforcement,\u201d post, at 8\u20139, but in Gant, there were real and important law enforcement interests at stake.  See 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136) (Alito, J., dissenting).  Even the Court conceded that the Belton rule had \u201cbeen widely taught in police academies and that law enforcement officers ha[d] relied on the rule in conducting vehicle searches during the past 28 years.\u201d  556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  And whatever else might be said about Belton, it surely provided a bright-line rule.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A month ago, none of this counted for much, but today the dissent writes:\n\u201cJackson\u2019s bright-line rule has provided law enforcement officers with clear guidance, allowed prosecutors to quickly and easily assess whether confessions will be admissible in court, and assisted judges in determining whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights have been violated by police interrogation.\u201d  Post, at 8.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is striking that precisely the same points were true in Gant:\n\u201c[Belton\u2019s] bright-line rule ha[d] provided law enforcement officers with clear guidance, allowed prosecutors to quickly and easily assess whether [evidence obtained in a vehicle search] w[ould] be admissible in court, and assisted judges in determining whether a defendant\u2019s [Fourth] Amendment rights ha[d] been violated by police interrogation.\u201d  Post, at 8.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent, finally, invokes Jackson\u2019s antiquity, stating that \u201cthe 23-year existence of a simple bright-line rule\u201d should weigh in favor of its retention.  Post, at 9.  But in Gant, the Court had no compunction about casting aside a 28-year-old bright-line rule.  I can only assume that the dissent thinks that our constitutional precedents are like certain wines, which are most treasured when they are neither too young nor too old, and that Jackson, at 23, is in its prime, whereas Belton, at 28, had turned brownish and vinegary.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the dissent that stare decisis should promote \u201c\u00a0\u2018the evenhanded \u2026 development of legal principles,\u2019\u00a0\u201d post, at 6 (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\u2013828 (1991)).  The treatment of stare decisis in Gant fully supports the decision in the present case.\n*\u00a0One of the dissenters in the present case, Justice Breyer, also dissented in Gant and would have followed Belton on stare decisis grounds.  See 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Thus, he would not overrule either Belton or Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)."}, {"id": 1774, "title": "Dissenting opinion", "author": null, "type": {"value": "dissenting", "label": "Dissenting opinion"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962900, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/778/dissent2.html", "judge_full_name": "Stephen G.

Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986), is indefensible.  Yet the Court does not reverse.  Rather, on its own initiative and without any evidence that the longstanding Sixth Amendment protections established in Jackson have caused any harm to the workings of the criminal justice system, the Court rejects Jackson outright on the ground that it is \u201cuntenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.\u201d  Ante, at 6.  That conclusion rests on a misinterpretation of Jackson\u2019s rationale and a gross undervaluation of the rule of stare decisis.  The police interrogation in this case clearly violated petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  \nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right \u2026 to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d  The right to counsel attaches during \u201cthe initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings,\u201d Rothgery v. Gillespie County, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it guarantees the assistance of counsel not only during in-court proceedings but during all critical stages, including postarraignment interviews with law enforcement officers, see Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 290 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Jackson, this Court considered whether the Sixth Amendment bars police from interrogating defendants who have requested the appointment of counsel at arraignment.  Applying the presumption that such a request constitutes an invocation of the right to counsel \u201cat every critical stage of the prosecution,\u201d 475 U. S., at 633, we held that \u201ca defendant who has been formally charged with a crime and who has requested appointment of counsel at his arraignment\u201d cannot be subject to uncounseled interrogation unless he initiates \u201cexchanges or conversations with the police,\u201d id., at 626.    \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, petitioner Jesse Montejo contends that police violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by interrogating him following his \u201c72-hour hearing\u201d outside the presence of, and without prior notice to, his lawyer.  The Louisiana Supreme Court rejected Montejo\u2019s claim.  Relying on the fact that the defendants in Jackson had \u201crequested\u201d counsel at arraignment, the state court held that Jackson\u2019s protections did not apply to Montejo because his counsel was appointed automatically; Montejo had not explicitly requested counsel or affirmatively accepted the counsel appointed to represent him before he submitted to police interrogation.  06\u20131807, pp. 28\u201329 (1/16/08), 974 So.\u00a02d 1238, 1261.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s decision, if allowed to stand, \u201cwould lead either to an unworkable standard, or to arbitrary and anomalous distinctions between defendants in different States,\u201d ante, at 3.  Neither option is tolerable, and neither is compelled by Jackson itself.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Jackson involved two consolidated cases, both arising in the State of Michigan.  Under Michigan law in effect at that time, when a defendant appeared for arraignment the court was required to inform him that counsel would be provided if he was financially needy and he requested representation.  Mich. Gen. Ct. Rule 785.4(1) (1976).  It was undisputed that the Jackson defendants made such a \u201crequest\u201d at their arraignment: one by completing an affidavit of indigency, and the other by responding affirmatively to a question posed to him by the court.  See App. in Michigan v. Jackson, O. T. 1984, No. 84\u20131531, p. 168; App. in Michigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1984, No. 84\u20131539, pp. 3a\u20134a.  In neither case, however, was it clear that counsel had actually been appointed at the arraignment.  Thus, the defendants\u2019 requests for counsel were significant as a matter of state law because they served as evidence that the appointment of counsel had been effectuated even in the absence of proof that defense counsel had actual notice of the appointments.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike Michigan, Louisiana does not require a defendant to make a request in order to receive court-appointed counsel.  Consequently, there is no reason to place constitutional significance on the fact that Montejo neither voiced a request for counsel nor affirmatively embraced that appointment post hoc.  Certainly our decision in Jackson did not mandate such an odd rule.  See ante, at 4 (acknowledging that we had no occasion to decide in Jackson how its rule would apply in States that do not make appointment of counsel contingent on affirmative request).  If a defendant is entitled to protection from police-initiated interrogation under the Sixth Amendment when he merely requests a lawyer, he is even more obviously entitled to such protection when he has secured a lawyer.  Indeed, we have already recognized as much.  See Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 352 (1990) (acknowledging that \u201conce a defendant obtains or even requests counsel,\u201d Jackson alters the waiver analysis); Patterson, 487 U. S., at 290, n. 3 (noting \u201cas a matter of some significance\u201d to the constitutional analysis that defendant had \u201cnot retained, or accepted by appointment, a lawyer to represent him at the time he was questioned by authorities\u201d (emphasis added)).[Footnote 1]  Once an attorney-client relationship has been established through the appointment or retention of counsel, as a matter of federal law the method by which the relationship was created is irrelevant: The existence of a valid attorney-client relationship provides a defendant with the full constitutional protection afforded by the Sixth Amendment.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today the Court correctly concludes that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s holding is \u201ctroublesome,\u201d ante, at 4, \u201cimpractical,\u201d ante, at 5, and \u201cunsound,\u201d ante, at 6.  Instead of reversing the decision of the state court by simply answering the question on which we granted certiorari in a unanimous opinion, however, the majority has decided to change the law.  Acting on its own initiative, the majority overrules Jackson to correct a \u201ctheoretical and doctrinal\u201d problem of its own imagining, see ante, at 6.  A more careful reading of Jackson and the Sixth Amendment cases upon which it relied reveals that the rule announced in Jackson protects a fundamental right that the Court now dishonors.   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s decision to overrule Jackson rests on its assumption that Jackson\u2019s protective rule was intended to \u201cprevent police from badgering defendants into changing their minds about their rights,\u201d ante, at 10; see also ante, at 13, just as the rule adopted in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), was designed to prevent police from coercing unindicted suspects into revoking their requests for counsel at interrogation.  Operating on that limited understanding of the purpose behind Jackson\u2019s protective rule, the Court concludes that Jackson provides no safeguard not already secured by this Court\u2019s Fifth Amendment jurisprudence.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966) (requiring defendants to be admonished of their right to counsel prior to custodial interrogation); Edwards, 451 U. S. 477 (prohibiting police-initiated interrogation following defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to counsel).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s analysis flagrantly misrepresents Jackson\u2019s underlying rationale and the constitutional interests the decision sought to protect.  While it is true that the rule adopted in Jackson was patterned after the rule in Edwards, 451 U. S., at 484\u2013485, the Jackson opinion does not even mention the anti-badgering considerations that provide the basis for the Court\u2019s decision today.  Instead, Jackson relied primarily on cases discussing the broad protections guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\u2014not its Fifth Amendment counterpart.  Jackson emphasized that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is to \u201c\u00a0\u2018protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations with his adversary,\u2019\u00a0\u201d 475 U. S., at 631 (quoting United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 189 (1984)), by giving him \u201c\u00a0\u2018the right to rely on counsel as a \u2018medium\u2019 between him[self] and the State,\u2019\u00a0\u201d  475 U. S., at 632 (quoting Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)).  Underscoring that the commencement of criminal proceedings is a decisive event that transforms a suspect into an accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, we concluded that arraigned defendants are entitled to \u201cat least as much protection\u201d during interrogation as the Fifth Amendment affords unindicted suspects.  See, e.g., 475 U. S., at 632 (\u201c[T]he difference between the legal basis for the rule applied in Edwards and the Sixth Amendment claim asserted in these cases actually provides additional support for the application of the rule in these circumstances\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, although the rules adopted in Edwards and Jackson are similar, Jackson did not rely on the reasoning of Edwards but remained firmly rooted in the unique protections afforded to the attorney-client relationship by the Sixth Amendment.[Footnote 2]   \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once Jackson is placed in its proper Sixth Amendment context, the majority\u2019s justifications for overruling the decision crumble.  Ordinarily, this Court is hesitant to disturb past precedent and will do so only when a rule has proven \u201coutdated, ill-founded, unworkable, or otherwise legitimately vulnerable to serious reconsideration.\u201d  Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986).  While stare decisis is not \u201can inexorable command,\u201d we adhere to it as \u201cthe preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\u2013828 (1991).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paying lip service to the rule of stare decisis, the majority acknowledges that the Court must consider many factors before taking the dramatic step of overruling a past decision.  See ante, at 12.  Specifically, the majority focuses on four considerations: the reasoning of the decision, the workability of the rule, the reliance interests at stake, and the antiquity of the precedent.  The Court exaggerates the considerations favoring reversal, however, and gives short shrift to the valid considerations favoring retention of the Jackson rule.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, and most central to the Court\u2019s decision to overrule Jackson, is its assertion that Jackson\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018reasoning\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u2014which the Court defines as \u201cthe weighing of the [protective] rule\u2019s benefits against its costs,\u201d ante, at 14\u2014does not justify continued application of the rule it created.  The balancing test the Court performs, however, depends entirely on its misunderstanding of Jackson as a rule designed to prevent police badgering, rather than a rule designed to safeguard a defendant\u2019s right to rely on the assistance of counsel.[Footnote 3]   \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, in order to reach the conclusion that the Jackson rule is unworkable, the Court reframes the relevant inquiry, asking not whether the Jackson rule as applied for the past quarter century has proved easily administrable, but instead whether the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s cramped interpretation of that rule is practically workable.  The answer to that question, of course, is no.  When framed more broadly, however, the evidence is overwhelming that Jackson\u2019s simple, bright-line rule has done more to advance effective law enforcement than to undermine it.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a supplemental brief submitted by lawyers and judges with extensive experience in law enforcement and prosecution, amici Larry D. Thompson et\u00a0al. argue persuasively that Jackson\u2019s bright-line rule has provided law enforcement officers with clear guidance, allowed prosecutors to quickly and easily assess whether confessions will be admissible in court, and assisted judges in determining whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights have been violated by police interrogation.  See generally Thompson Supplemental Brief 6.  While amici acknowledge that \u201cJackson reduces opportunities to interrogate defendants\u201d and \u201cmay require exclusion of evidence that could support a criminal conviction,\u201d they maintain that \u201cit is a rare case where this rule lets a guilty defendant go free.\u201d  Ibid.  Notably, these representations are not contradicted by the State of Louisiana or other amici, including the United States.  See United States Brief 12 (conceding that the Jackson rule has not \u201cresulted in the suppression of significant numbers of statements in federal prosecutions in the past\u201d).[Footnote 4]  In short, there is substantial evidence suggesting that Jackson\u2019s rule is not only workable, but also desirable from the perspective of law enforcement.     \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the reliance interests at stake in the case, the Court rejects the interests of criminal defendants with the flippant observation that any who are knowledgeable enough to rely on Jackson are too savvy to need its protections, and casts aside the reliance interests of law enforcement on the ground that police and prosecutors remain free to employ the Jackson rule if it suits them.  See ante, at 12.  Again as a result of its mistaken understanding of the purpose behind Jackson\u2019s protective rule, the Court fails to identify the real reliance interest at issue in this case: the public\u2019s interest in knowing that counsel, once secured, may be reasonably relied upon as a medium between the accused and the power of the State.  That interest lies at the heart of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee, and is surely worthy of greater consideration than it is given by today\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, although the Court acknowledges that \u201cantiquity\u201d is a factor that counsels in favor of retaining precedent, it concludes that the fact Jackson is \u201conly two decades old\u201d cuts \u201cin favor of abandoning\u201d the rule it established.  Ante, at 13.  I would have thought that the 23-year existence of a simple bright-line rule would be a factor that cuts in the other direction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the fact that the rule established in Jackson remains relevant, well grounded in constitutional precedent, and easily administrable, the Court today rejects it sU. S.onte.  Such a decision can only diminish the public\u2019s confidence in the reliability and fairness of our system of justice.[Footnote 5]  \nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if Jackson had never been decided, it would be clear that Montejo\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated.  Today\u2019s decision eliminates the rule that \u201cany waiver of Sixth Amendment rights given in a discussion initiated by police is presumed invalid\u201d once a defendant has invoked his right to counsel.  Harvey, 494 U. S., at 349 (citing Jackson, 475 U. S., at 636).  Nevertheless, under the undisputed facts of this case, there is no sound basis for concluding that Montejo made a knowing and valid waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before acquiescing in police interrogation following his 72-hour hearing.  Because police questioned Montejo without notice to, and outside the presence of, his lawyer, the interrogation violated Montejo\u2019s right to counsel even under pre-Jackson precedent.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our pre-Jackson case law makes clear that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment is violated when the State obtains incriminating statements by knowingly circumventing the accused\u2019s right to have counsel present in a confrontation between the accused and a state agent.\u201d  Moulton, 474 U. S., at 176.  The Sixth Amendment entitles indicted defendants to have counsel notified of and present during critical confrontations with the state throughout the pretrial process.  Given the realities of modern criminal prosecution, the critical proceedings at which counsel\u2019s assistance is required more and more often occur outside the courtroom in pretrial proceedings \u201cwhere the results might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality.\u201d  United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 224 (1967).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Wade, for instance, we held that because a post-indictment lineup conducted for identification purposes is a critical stage of the criminal proceedings, a defendant and his counsel are constitutionally entitled to notice of the impending lineup.  Accordingly, counsel\u2019s presence is a \u201crequisite to conduct of the lineup, absent an intelligent waiver.\u201d  Id., at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same reasoning applies to police decisions to interrogate represented defendants.  For if the Sixth Amendment entitles an accused to such robust protection during a lineup, surely it entitles him to such protection during a custodial interrogation, when the stakes are as high or higher.  Cf. Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959) (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]hat use is a defendant\u2019s right to effective counsel at every stage of a criminal case if, while he is held awaiting trial, he can be questioned in the absence of counsel until he confesses?\u201d).  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court avoids confronting the serious Sixth Amendment concerns raised by the police interrogation in this case by assuming that Montejo validly waived his Sixth Amendment rights before submitting to interrogation.[Footnote 6]  It does so by summarily concluding that \u201cdoctrines ensuring voluntariness of the Fifth Amendment waiver simultaneously ensure the voluntariness of the Sixth Amendment waiver,\u201d ante, at 15\u201316; thus, because Montejo was given Miranda warnings prior to interrogation, his waiver was presumptively valid.  Ironically, while the Court faults Jackson for blurring the line between this Court\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, it commits the same error by assuming that the Miranda warnings given in this case, designed purely to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, were somehow adequate to protect Montejo\u2019s more robust Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority\u2019s cursory treatment of the waiver question rests entirely on the dubious decision in Patterson, in which we addressed whether, by providing Miranda warnings, police had adequately advised an indicted but unrepresented defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The majority held that \u201c[a]s a general matter \u2026 an accused who is admonished with the warnings prescribed \u2026 in Miranda, \u2026 has been sufficiently apprised of the nature of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the consequences of abandoning those rights.\u201d  487 U. S., at 296.  The Court recognized, however, that \u201cbecause the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection of the attorney-client relationship \u2026 extends beyond Miranda\u2019s protection of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel, \u2026 there will be cases where a waiver which would be valid under Miranda will not suffice for Sixth Amendment purposes.\u201d  Id., at 297, n.\u00a09.  This is such a case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I observed in Patterson, the conclusion that Miranda warnings ordinarily provide a sufficient basis for a knowing waiver of the right to counsel rests on the questionable assumption that those warnings make clear to defendants the assistance a lawyer can render during post-indictment interrogation.  See 487 U. S., at 307 (dissenting opinion).  Because Miranda warnings do not hint at the ways in which a lawyer might assist her client during conversations with the police, I remain convinced that the warnings prescribed in Miranda,[Footnote 7] while sufficient to apprise a defendant of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, are inadequate to inform an unrepresented, indicted defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to have a lawyer present at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution.  The inadequacy of those warnings is even more obvious in the case of a represented defendant.  While it can be argued that informing an indicted but unrepresented defendant of his right to counsel at least alerts him to the fact that he is entitled to obtain something he does not already possess, providing that same warning to a defendant who has already secured counsel is more likely to confound than enlighten.[Footnote 8]  By glibly assuming that that the Miranda warnings given in this case were sufficient to ensure Montejo\u2019s waiver was both knowing and voluntary, the Court conveniently avoids any comment on the actual advice Montejo received, which did not adequately inform him of his relevant Sixth Amendment rights or alert him to the possible consequences of waiving those rights.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A defendant\u2019s decision to forgo counsel\u2019s assistance and speak openly with police is a momentous one.  Given the high stakes of making such a choice and the potential value of counsel\u2019s advice and mediation at that critical stage of the criminal proceedings, it is imperative that a defendant possess \u201ca full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it,\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421 (1986), before his waiver is deemed valid.  See Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).  Because the administration of Miranda warnings was insufficient to ensure Montejo understood the Sixth Amendment right he was being asked to surrender, the record in this case provides no basis for concluding that Montejo validly waived his right to counsel, even in the absence of Jackson\u2019s enhanced protections.    \nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s decision to overrule Jackson is unwarranted.  Not only does it rests on a flawed doctrinal premise, but the dubious benefits it hopes to achieve are far outweighed by the damage it does to the rule of law and the integrity of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Moreover, even apart from the protections afforded by Jackson, the police interrogation in this case violated Jesse Montejo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\u00a0In Patterson v. Illinois, we further explained, \u201c[o]nce an accused has a lawyer,\u201d \u201ca distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship takes effect.\u201d  487 U. S., at 290, n. 3 (citing Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)).  \u201cIndeed,\u201d we emphasized, \u201cthe analysis changes markedly once an accused even requests the assistance of counsel.\u201d  487 U. S., at 290, n.\u00a03.  \n\u00a0The majority insists that protection from police badgering is the only purpose the Jackson rule can plausibly serve.  After all, it asks, from what other evil would the rule guard?  See ante, at 9.  There are two obvious answers. First, most narrowly, it protects the defendant from any police-initiated interrogation without notice to his counsel, not just from \u201cbadgering\u201d which is not necessarily a part of police questioning.  Second, and of prime importance, it assures that any waiver of counsel will be valid. The assistance offered by counsel protects a defendant from surrendering his rights with an insufficient appreciation of what those rights are and how the decision to respond to interrogation might advance or compromise his exercise of those rights throughout the course of criminal proceedings.  A lawyer can provide her client with advice regarding the legal and practical options available to him; the potential consequences, both good and bad, of choosing to discuss his case with police; the likely effect of such a conversation on the resolution of the charges against him; and an informed assessment of the best course of action under the circumstances.  Such assistance goes far beyond mere protection against police badgering.               \n\u00a0Even accepting the majority\u2019s improper framing of Jackson\u2019s foundation, the Court fails to show that the costs of the rule are more than negligible or differ from any other protection afforded by the right to counsel.  The majority assumes, without citing any empirical or even anecdotal support, that any marginal benefits of the Jackson rule are \u201cdwarfed by its substantial costs,\u201d which it describes as harm to \u201c\u00a0\u2018society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 14 (quoting Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 426 (1986)).  That assumption is highly dubious, particularly in light of the fact that several amici with interest in law enforcement have conceded that the application of Jackson\u2019s protective rule rarely impedes prosecution.  See Supplemental Brief for Larry D. Thompson et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 6 (hereinafter Thompson Supplemental Brief); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12 (hereinafter United States Brief).\n\n\n\u00a0Further supporting the workability of the Jackson rule is the fact that it aligns with the professional standards and norms that already govern the behavior of police and prosecutors.  Rules of Professional Conduct endorsed by the American Bar Association (ABA) and by every State Bar Association in the country prohibit prosecutors from making direct contact with represented defendants in all but the most limited of circumstances, see App. to Supplemental Brief for Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 1a\u201315a (setting forth state rules governing contact with represented persons); ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2008); 28 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7530B(a) (making state rules of professional conduct applicable to federal attorneys), and generations of police officers have been trained to refrain from approaching represented defendants, both because Jackson requires it and because, absent direction from prosecutors, officers are reticent to interrogate represented defendants.  See United States Brief 11\u201312; see also Thompson Supplemental Brief 13 (citing Federal Bureau of Investigation, Legal Handbook for Special Agents \u00a77\u20134.1(7) (2003)).  Indeed, the United States concedes that a decision to overrule the case \u201clikely w[ill] not significantly alter the manner in which federal law enforcement agents investigate indicted defendants.\u201d  United States Brief 11\u201312. \n\u00a0In his concurrence, Justice Alito assumes that my consideration of the rule of stare decisis in this case is at odds with the Court\u2019s recent rejection of his reliance on that doctrine in his dissent in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  While I agree that the reasoning in his dissent supports my position in this case, I do not agree with his characterization of our opinion in Gant.  Contrary to his representation, the Court did not overrule our precedent in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981).  Rather, we affirmed the narrow interpretation of Belton\u2019s holding adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court, rejecting the broader interpretation adopted by other lower courts that had been roundly criticized by judges and scholars alike.  By contrast, in this case the Court flatly overrules Jackson\u2014a rule that has drawn virtually no criticism\u2014on its own initiative.  The two cases are hardly comparable.  If they were, and if Justice Alito meant what he said in Gant, I would expect him to join this opinion.   \n\u00a0The majority leaves open the possibility that, on remand, Montejo may argue that his waiver was invalid because police falsely told him he had not been appointed counsel.  See ante, at 18.  While such police deception would obviously invalidate any otherwise valid waiver of Montejo\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, Montejo has a strong argument that, given his status as a represented criminal defendant, the Miranda warnings given to him by police were insufficient to permit him to make a knowing waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights even absent police deception.  \n\u00a0Under Miranda, a suspect must be \u201cwarned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him in court of law, that he has the right to the presence of any attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d  384 U. S., at 479.  \n\u00a0With respect to vulnerable defendants, such as juveniles and those with mental impairments of various kinds, amici National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\u00a0al. assert that \u201c[o]verruling Jackson would be particularly detrimental \u2026 because of the confusing instructions regarding counsel that they would receive.  At the initial hearing, they would likely learn that an attorney was being appointed for them,  In a later custodial interrogation, however, they would be informed in the traditional manner of \u2018their right to counsel\u2019 and right to have counsel \u2018appointed\u2019 if they are indigent, notwithstanding that counsel had already been appointed in open court.  These conflicting statements would be confusing to anyone, but would be especially baffling to defendants with mental disabilities or other impairments.\u201d  Supplemental Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 7\u20138.

LOUISIANA\ncertiorari to the supreme court of louisiana\nNo. 07\u20131529.\u2003Argued January 13, 2009\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nAt a preliminary hearing required by Louisiana law, petitioner Montejo was charged with first-degree murder, and the court ordered the appointment of counsel.  Later that day, the police read Montejo his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he agreed to go along on a trip to locate the murder weapon.  During the excursion, he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim\u2019s widow.  Upon returning, he finally met his court-appointed attorney.  At trial, his letter was admitted over defense objection, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected his claim that the letter should have been suppressed under the rule of Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, which forbids police to initiate interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has invoked his right to counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding.  The court reasoned that Jackson\u2019s prophylactic protection is not triggered unless the defendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; and that, since Montejo stood mute at his hearing while the judge ordered the appointment of counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Michigan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled.  Pp.\u00a03\u201318.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The State Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Jackson would lead to practical problems.  Requiring an initial \u201cinvocation\u201d of the right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption, as the court below did, might work in States that require an indigent defendant formally to request counsel before an appointment is made, but not in more than half the States, which appoint counsel without request from the defendant.  Pp.\u00a03\u20136.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0On the other hand, Montejo\u2019s solution is untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.  Eliminating the invocation requirement entirely would depart fundamentally from the rationale of Jackson, whose presumption was created by analogy to a similar prophylactic rule established in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, to protect the Fifth Amendment-based Miranda right.  Both Edwards and Jackson are meant to prevent police from badgering defendants into changing their minds about the right to counsel once they have invoked it, but a defendant who never asked for counsel has not yet made up his mind in the first instance.  Pp.\u00a06\u201313.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Stare decisis does not require the Court to expand significantly the holding of a prior decision in order to cure its practical deficiencies.  To the contrary, the fact that a decision has proved \u201cunworkable\u201d is a traditional ground for overruling it.  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827.  Beyond workability, the relevant factors include the precedent\u2019s antiquity, the reliance interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___.  The first two cut in favor of jettisoning Jackson: the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it would not upset expectations, since any criminal defendant learned enough to order his affairs based on Jackson\u2019s rule would also be perfectly capable of interacting with the police on his own.  As for the strength of Jackson\u2019s reasoning, when this Court creates a prophylactic rule to protect a constitutional right, the relevant \u201creasoning\u201d is the weighing of the rule\u2019s benefits against its costs.  Jackson\u2019s marginal benefits are dwarfed by its substantial costs.  Even without Jackson, few badgering-induced waivers, if any, would be admitted at trial because the Court has taken substantial other, overlapping measures to exclude them.  Under Miranda, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation must be advised of his right to have a lawyer present.  384 U. S., at 474.  Under Edwards, once such a defendant \u201chas invoked his [Miranda] right,\u201d interrogation must stop.  451 U. S., at 484.  And under Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, no subsequent interrogation may take place until counsel is present.  Id., at 153.  These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient.  On the other side of the equation, the principal cost of applying Jackson\u2019s rule is that crimes can go unsolved and criminals unpunished when uncoerced confessions are excluded and when officers are deterred from even trying to obtain confessions.  The Court concludes that the Jackson rule does not \u201cpay its way,\u201d United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907\u2013908, n.\u00a06, and thus the case should be overruled.  Pp.\u00a013\u201318.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Montejo should nonetheless be given an opportunity to contend that his letter of apology should have been suppressed under the Edwards rule.  He understandably did not pursue an Edwards objection, because Jackson offered broader protections, but the decision here changes the legal landscape.

Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986), forbidding police to initiate interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has requested counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Jesse Montejo was arrested on September 6, 2002, in connection with the robbery and murder of Lewis Ferrari, who had been found dead in his own home one day earlier.  Suspicion quickly focused on Jerry Moore, a disgruntled former employee of Ferrari\u2019s dry cleaning business.  Police sought to question Montejo, who was a known associate of Moore.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and was interrogated at the sheriff\u2019s office by police detectives through the late afternoon and evening of September 6 and the early morning of September 7.  During the interrogation, Montejo repeatedly changed his account of the crime, at first claiming that he had only driven Moore to the victim\u2019s home, and ultimately admitting that he had shot and killed Ferrari in the course of a botched burglary.  These police interrogations were videotaped.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On September 10, Montejo was brought before a judge for what is known in Louisiana as a \u201c72-hour hearing\u201d\u2014a preliminary hearing required under state law.[Footnote 1]  Although the proceedings were not transcribed, the minute record indicates what transpired: \u201cThe defendant being charged with First Degree Murder, Court ordered N[o] Bond set in this matter.  Further, Court ordered the Office of Indigent Defender be appointed to represent the defendant.\u201d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later that same day, two police detectives visited Montejo back at the prison and requested that he accompany them on an excursion to locate the murder weapon (which Montejo had earlier indicated he had thrown into a lake).  After some back-and-forth, the substance of which remains in dispute, Montejo was again read his Miranda rights and agreed to go along; during the excursion, he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim\u2019s widow.  Only upon their return did Montejo finally meet his court-appointed attorney, who was quite upset that the detectives had interrogated his client in his absence.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At trial, the letter of apology was admitted over defense objection.  The jury convicted Montejo of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to death.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.  06\u20131807 (1/16/08), 974 So.\u00a02d 1238 (2008).  As relevant here, the court rejected Montejo\u2019s argument that under the rule of Jackson, supra, the letter should have been suppressed.  974 So.\u00a02d, at 1261.  Jackson held that \u201cif police initiate interrogation after a defendant\u2019s assertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\u201d  475 U. S., at 636.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Citing a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Montoya v. Collins, 955 F.\u00a02d 279 (1992), the Louisiana Supreme Court reasoned that the prophylactic protection of Jackson is not triggered unless and until the defendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  974 So.\u00a02d, at 1260\u20131261, and n.\u00a068.  Because Montejo simply stood mute at his 72-hour hearing while the judge ordered the appointment of counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.  So the proper inquiry, the court ruled, was only whether he had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to have counsel present during the interaction with the police.  Id., at 1261.  And because Montejo had been read his Miranda rights and agreed to waive them, the Court answered that question in the affirmative, 974 So.\u00a02d, at 1262, and upheld the conviction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  554 U. S. ___ (2008).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo and his amici raise a number of pragmatic objections to the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Jackson.  We agree that the approach taken below would lead either to an unworkable standard, or to arbitrary and anomalous distinctions between defendants in different States.  Neither would be acceptable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the rule adopted by the Louisiana Supreme Court, a criminal defendant must request counsel, or otherwise \u201cassert\u201d his Sixth Amendment right at the preliminary hearing, before the Jackson protections are triggered.  If he does so, the police may not initiate further interrogation in the absence of counsel.  But if the court on its own appoints counsel, with the defendant taking no affirmative action to invoke his right to counsel, then police are free to initiate further interrogations provided that they first obtain an otherwise valid waiver by the defendant of his right to have counsel present.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This rule would apply well enough in States that require the indigent defendant formally to request counsel before any appointment is made, which usually occurs after the court has informed him that he will receive counsel if he asks for it.  That is how the system works in Michigan, for example, Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(A) (2009), whose scheme produced the factual background for this Court\u2019s decision in Michigan v. Jackson.  Jackson, like all other represented indigent defendants in the State, had requested counsel in accordance with the applicable state law.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But many States follow other practices.  In some two dozen, the appointment of counsel is automatic upon a finding of indigency, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a722\u20134503(c) (2007); and in a number of others, appointment can be made either upon the defendant\u2019s request or sU. S.onte by the court, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29, \u00a74602(a) (2003).  See App. to Brief for National Legal Aid & Defender Assn. et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 1a\u201321a.  Nothing in our Jackson opinion indicates whether we were then aware that not all States require that a defendant affirmatively request counsel before one is appointed; and of course we had no occasion there to decide how the rule we announced would apply to these other States.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s answer to that unresolved question is troublesome.  The central distinction it draws\u2014between defendants who \u201cassert\u201d their right to counsel and those who do not\u2014is exceedingly hazy when applied to States that appoint counsel absent request from the defendant.  How to categorize a defendant who merely asks, prior to appointment, whether he will be appointed counsel?  Or who inquires, after the fact, whether he has been?  What treatment for one who thanks the court after the appointment is made?  And if the court asks a defendant whether he would object to appointment, will a quick shake of his head count as an assertion of his right?\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s rule also permits a defendant to trigger Jackson through the \u201cacceptance\u201d of counsel, that notion is even more mysterious: How does one affirmatively accept counsel appointed by court order?  An indigent defendant has no right to choose his counsel, United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 151 (2006), so it is hard to imagine what his \u201cacceptance\u201d would look like, beyond the passive silence that Montejo exhibited.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In practice, judicial application of the Louisiana rule in States that do not require a defendant to make a request for counsel could take either of two paths.  Courts might ask on a case-by-case basis whether a defendant has somehow invoked his right to counsel, looking to his conduct at the preliminary hearing\u2014his statements and gestures\u2014and the totality of the circumstances.  Or, courts might simply determine as a categorical matter that defendants in these States\u2014over half of those in the Union\u2014simply have no opportunity to assert their right to counsel at the hearing and are therefore out of luck.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither approach is desirable.  The former would be particularly impractical in light of the fact that, as amici describe, preliminary hearings are often rushed, and are frequently not recorded or transcribed.  Brief for National Legal Aid & Defender Assn. et\u00a0al. 25\u201330.  The sheer volume of indigent defendants, see id., at 29, would render the monitoring of each particular defendant\u2019s reaction to the appointment of counsel almost impossible.  And sometimes the defendant is not even present.  E.g., La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 230.1(A) (West Supp. 2009) (allowing court to appoint counsel if defendant is \u201cunable to appear\u201d).  Police who did not attend the hearing would have no way to know whether they could approach a particular defendant; and for a court to adjudicate that question ex post would be a fact-intensive and burdensome task, even if monitoring were possible and transcription available.  Because \u201cclarity of \u2026 command\u201d and \u201ccertainty of \u2026 application\u201d are crucial in rules that govern law enforcement, Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 151 (1990), this would be an unfortunate way to proceed.  See also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425\u2013426 (1986).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second possible course fares no better, for it would achieve clarity and certainty only at the expense of introducing arbitrary distinctions: Defendants in States that automatically appoint counsel would have no opportunity to invoke their rights and trigger Jackson, while those in other States, effectively instructed by the court to request counsel, would be lucky winners.  That sort of hollow formalism is out of place in a doctrine that purports to serve as a practical safeguard for defendants\u2019 rights.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s application of Jackson is unsound as a practical matter, then Montejo\u2019s solution is untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.  Under his approach, once a defendant is represented by counsel, police may not initiate any further interrogation.  Such a rule would be entirely untethered from the original rationale of Jackson.\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is worth emphasizing first what is not in dispute or at stake here.  Under our precedents, once the adversary judicial process has been initiated, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present at all \u201ccritical\u201d stages of the criminal proceedings.  United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 227\u2013228 (1967); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57 (1932).  Interrogation by the State is such a stage.  Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 204\u2013205 (1964); see also United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264, 274 (1980).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our precedents also place beyond doubt that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be waived by a defendant, so long as relinquishment of the right is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.  Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 292, n.\u00a04 (1988); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).  The defendant may waive the right whether or not he is already represented by counsel; the decision to waive need not itself be counseled.  Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 352\u2013353 (1990).  And when a defendant is read his Miranda rights (which include the right to have counsel present during interrogation) and agrees to waive those rights, that typically does the trick, even though the Miranda rights purportedly have their source in the Fifth Amendment:\n\u201cAs a general matter \u2026 an accused who is admonished with the warnings prescribed by this Court in Miranda \u2026 has been sufficiently apprised of the nature of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the consequences of abandoning those rights, so that his waiver on this basis will be considered a knowing and intelligent one.\u201d  Patterson, supra, at 296.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only question raised by this case, and the only one addressed by the Jackson rule, is whether courts must presume that such a waiver is invalid under certain circumstances.  475 U. S., at 630, 633.  We created such a presumption in Jackson by analogy to a similar prophylactic rule established to protect the Fifth Amendment based Miranda right to have counsel present at any custodial interrogation.  Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), decided that once \u201can accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation \u2026 [he] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available,\u201d unless he initiates the contact.  Id., at 484\u2013485.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Edwards rule is \u201cdesigned to prevent police from badgering a defendant into waiving his previously asserted Miranda rights,\u201d Harvey, supra, at 350.  It does this by presuming his postassertion statements to be involuntary, \u201ceven where the suspect executes a waiver and his statements would be considered voluntary under traditional standards.\u201d  McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 177 (1991).  This prophylactic rule thus \u201cprotect[s] a suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer\u2019s presence.\u201d  Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 175 (2001) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jackson represented a \u201cwholesale importation of the Edwards rule into the Sixth Amendment.\u201d  Cobb, supra, at 175.  The Jackson Court decided that a request for counsel at an arraignment should be treated as an invocation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u201cat every critical stage of the prosecution,\u201d 475 U. S., at 633, despite doubt that defendants \u201cactually inten[d] their request for counsel to encompass representation during any further questioning,\u201d id., at 632\u2013633, because doubts must be \u201cresolved in favor of protecting the constitutional claim,\u201d id., at 633.  Citing Edwards, the Court held that any subsequent waiver would thus be \u201cinsufficient to justify police-initiated interrogation.\u201d  475 U. S., at 635.  In other words, we presume such waivers involuntary \u201cbased on the supposition that suspects who assert their right to counsel are unlikely to waive that right voluntarily\u201d in subsequent interactions with police.  Harvey, supra, at 350.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent presents us with a revisionist view of Jackson.  The defendants\u2019 request for counsel, it contends, was important only because it proved that counsel had been appointed.  Such a non sequitur (nowhere alluded to in the case) hardly needs rebuttal.  Proceeding from this fanciful premise, the dissent claims that the decision actually established \u201ca rule designed to safeguard a defendant\u2019s right to rely on the assistance of counsel,\u201d post, at 6\u20137 (opinion of Stevens, J.), not one \u201cdesigned to prevent police badgering,\u201d post, at 7.  To safeguard the right to assistance of counsel from what?  From a knowing and voluntary waiver by the defendant himself?  Unless the dissent seeks to prevent a defendant altogether from waiving his Sixth Amendment rights, i.e., to \u201cimprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution,\u201d Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 280 (1942)\u2014a view with zero support in reason, history or case law\u2014the answer must be: from police pressure, i.e., badgering.  The antibadgering rationale is the only way to make sense of Jackson\u2019s repeated citations of Edwards, and the only way to reconcile the opinion with our waiver jurisprudence.[Footnote 2]\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With this understanding of what Jackson stands for and whence it came, it should be clear that Montejo\u2019s interpretation of that decision\u2014that no represented defendant can ever be approached by the State and asked to consent to interrogation\u2014is off the mark.  When a court appoints counsel for an indigent defendant in the absence of any request on his part, there is no basis for a presumption that any subsequent waiver of the right to counsel will be involuntary.  There is no \u201cinitial election\u201d to exercise the right, Patterson, 487 U. S., at 291, that must be preserved through a prophylactic rule against later waivers.  No reason exists to assume that a defendant like Montejo, who has done nothing at all to express his intentions with respect to his Sixth Amendment rights, would not be perfectly amenable to speaking with the police without having counsel present.  And no reason exists to prohibit the police from inquiring.  Edwards and Jackson are meant to prevent police from badgering defendants into changing their minds about their rights, but a defendant who never asked for counsel has not yet made up his mind in the first instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent\u2019s argument to the contrary rests on a flawed a fortiori: \u201cIf a defendant is entitled to protection from police-initiated interrogation under the Sixth Amendment when he merely requests a lawyer, he is even more obviously entitled to such protection when he has secured a lawyer.\u201d  Post, at 3.  The question in Jackson, however, was not whether respondents were entitled to counsel (they unquestionably were), but \u201cwhether respondents validly waived their right to counsel,\u201d 475 U. S., at 630; and even if it is reasonable to presume from a defendant\u2019s request for counsel that any subsequent waiver of the right was coerced, no such presumption can seriously be entertained when a lawyer was merely \u201csecured\u201d on the defendant\u2019s behalf, by the State itself, as a matter of course.  Of course, reading the dissent\u2019s analysis, one would have no idea that Montejo executed any waiver at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In practice, Montejo\u2019s rule would prevent police-initiated interrogation entirely once the Sixth Amendment right attaches, at least in those States that appoint counsel promptly without request from the defendant.  As the dissent in Jackson pointed out, with no expressed disagreement from the majority, the opinion \u201cmost assuredly [did] not hold that the Edwards per se rule prohibiting all police-initiated interrogations applies from the moment the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, with or without a request for counsel by the defendant.\u201d  475 U. S., at 640 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.).  That would have constituted a \u201cshockingly dramatic restructuring of the balance this Court has traditionally struck between the rights of the defendant and those of the larger society.\u201d  Ibid.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo\u2019s rule appears to have its theoretical roots in codes of legal ethics, not the Sixth Amendment.  The American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rules of Professional Conduct (which nearly all States have adopted into law in whole or in part) mandate that \u201ca lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of [a] representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.\u201d  Model Rule 4.2 (2008).  But the Constitution does not codify the ABA\u2019s Model Rules, and does not make investigating police officers lawyers.  Montejo\u2019s proposed rule is both broader and narrower than the Model Rule.  Broader, because Montejo would apply it to all agents of the State, including the detectives who interrogated him, while the ethical rule governs only lawyers.  And narrower, because he agrees that if a defendant initiates contact with the police, they may talk freely\u2014whereas a lawyer could be sanctioned for interviewing a represented party even if that party \u201cinitiates\u201d the communication and consents to the interview.  Model Rule 4.2, Comment 3.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo contends that our decisions support his interpretation of the Jackson rule.  We think not.  Many of the cases he cites concern the substantive scope of the Sixth Amendment\u2014e.g., whether a particular interaction with the State constitutes a \u201ccritical\u201d stage at which counsel is entitled to be present\u2014not the validity of a Sixth Amendment waiver.  See Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985); Henry, 447 U. S. 264; Massiah, 377 U. S. 201; see also Moran, 475 U. S. 412.  Since everyone agrees that absent a valid waiver, Montejo was entitled to a lawyer during the interrogation, those cases do not advance his argument.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo also points to descriptions of the Jackson holding in two later cases.  In one, we noted that \u201canalysis of the waiver issue changes\u201d once a defendant \u201cobtains or even requests counsel.\u201d  Harvey, 494 U. S., at 352.  But elsewhere in the same opinion, we explained that Jackson applies \u201cafter a defendant requests assistance of counsel,\u201d 494 U. S., at 349; \u201cwhen a suspect charged with a crime requests counsel outside the context of interrogation,\u201d id., at 350; and to \u201csuspects who assert their right to counsel,\u201d ibid.  The accuracy of the \u201cobtains\u201d language is thus questionable.  Anyway, since Harvey held that evidence obtained in violation of the Jackson rule could be admitted to impeach the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, 494 U. S., at 346, the Court\u2019s varying descriptions of when the rule was violated were dicta.  The dictum from the other decision, Patterson, supra, at 290, n.\u00a03, is no more probative.[Footnote 3]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upshot is that even on Jackson\u2019s own terms, it would be completely unjustified to presume that a defendant\u2019s consent to police-initiated interrogation was involuntary or coerced simply because he had previously been appointed a lawyer.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So on the one hand, requiring an initial \u201cinvocation\u201d of the right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption is consistent with the theory of that decision, but (as Montejo and his amici argue, see Part II, supra) would be unworkable in more than half the States of the Union.  On the other hand, eliminating the invocation requirement would render the rule easy to apply but depart fundamentally from the Jackson rationale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not think that stare decisis requires us to expand significantly the holding of a prior decision\u2014fundamentally revising its theoretical basis in the process\u2014in order to cure its practical deficiencies.  To the contrary, the fact that a decision has proved \u201cunworkable\u201d is a traditional ground for overruling it.  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).  Accordingly, we called for supplemental briefing addressed to the question whether Michigan v. Jackson should be overruled.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).  The first two cut in favor of abandoning Jackson: the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it would not upset expectations.  Any criminal defendant learned enough to order his affairs based on the rule announced in Jackson would also be perfectly capable of interacting with the police on his own.  Of course it is likely true that police and prosecutors have been trained to comply with Jackson, see generally Supplemental Brief for Larry D. Thompson et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae, but that is hardly a basis for retaining it as a constitutional requirement.  If a State wishes to abstain from requesting interviews with represented defendants when counsel is not present, it obviously may continue to do so.[Footnote 4]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which brings us to the strength of Jackson\u2019s reasoning.  When this Court creates a prophylactic rule in order to protect a constitutional right, the relevant \u201creasoning\u201d is the weighing of the rule\u2019s benefits against its costs.  \u201cThe value of any prophylactic rule \u2026 must be assessed not only on the basis of what is gained, but also on the basis of what is lost.\u201d  Minnick, 498 U. S., at 161 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  We think that the marginal benefits of Jackson (viz., the number of confessions obtained coercively that are suppressed by its bright-line rule and would otherwise have been admitted) are dwarfed by its substantial costs (viz., hindering \u201csociety\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law,\u201d Moran, supra, at 426).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What does the Jackson rule actually achieve by way of preventing unconstitutional conduct?  Recall that the purpose of the rule is to preclude the State from badgering defendants into waiving their previously asserted rights.  See Harvey, supra, at 350; see also McNeil, 501 U. S., at 177.  The effect of this badgering might be to coerce a waiver, which would render the subsequent interrogation a violation of the Sixth Amendment.  See Massiah, supra, at 204.  Even though involuntary waivers are invalid even apart from Jackson, see Patterson, 487 U. S., at 292, n.\u00a04, mistakes are of course possible when courts conduct case-by-case voluntariness review.  A bright-line rule like that adopted in Jackson ensures that no fruits of interrogations made possible by badgering-induced involuntary waivers are ever erroneously admitted at trial.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But without Jackson, how many would be?  The answer is few if any.  The principal reason is that the Court has already taken substantial other, overlapping measures toward the same end.  Under Miranda\u2019s prophylactic protection of the right against compelled self-incrimination, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to have a lawyer present if he so requests, and to be advised of that right.  384 U. S., at 474.  Under Edwards\u2019 prophylactic protection of the Miranda right, once such a defendant \u201chas invoked his right to have counsel present,\u201d interrogation must stop.  451 U. S., at 484.  And under Minnick\u2019s prophylactic protection of the Edwards right, no subsequent interrogation may take place until counsel is present, \u201cwhether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.\u201d  498 U. S., at 153.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient.  Under the Miranda-Edwards-Minnick line of cases (which is not in doubt), a defendant who does not want to speak to the police without counsel present need only say as much when he is first approached and given the Miranda warnings.  At that point, not only must the immediate contact end, but \u201cbadgering\u201d by later requests is prohibited.  If that regime suffices to protect the integrity of \u201ca suspect\u2019s voluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer\u2019s presence\u201d before his arraignment, Cobb, 532 U. S., at 175 (Kennedy, J., concurring), it is hard to see why it would not also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment, when Sixth Amendment rights have attached.  And if so, then Jackson is simply superfluous.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true, as Montejo points out in his supplemental brief, that the doctrine established by Miranda and Edwards is designed to protect Fifth Amendment, not Sixth Amendment, rights.  But that is irrelevant.  What matters is that these cases, like Jackson, protect the right to have counsel during custodial interrogation\u2014which right happens to be guaranteed (once the adversary judicial process has begun) by two sources of law.  Since the right under both sources is waived using the same procedure, Patterson, supra, at 296, doctrines ensuring voluntariness of the Fifth Amendment waiver simultaneously ensure the voluntariness of the Sixth Amendment waiver.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo also correctly observes that the Miranda-Edwards regime is narrower than Jackson in one respect: The former applies only in the context of custodial interrogation.  If the defendant is not in custody then those decisions do not apply; nor do they govern other, noninterrogative types of interactions between the defendant and the State (like pretrial lineups).  However, those uncovered situations are the least likely to pose a risk of coerced waivers.  When a defendant is not in custody, he is in control, and need only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badgering.  And noninterrogative interactions with the State do not involve the \u201cinherently compelling pressures,\u201d Miranda, supra, at 467, that one might reasonably fear could lead to involuntary waivers.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jackson was policy driven, and if that policy is being adequately served through other means, there is no reason to retain its rule.  Miranda and the cases that elaborate upon it already guarantee not simply noncoercion in the traditional sense, but what Justice Harlan referred to as \u201cvoluntariness with a vengeance,\u201d 384 U. S., at 505 (dissenting opinion).  There is no need to take Jackson\u2019s further step of requiring voluntariness on stilts.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other side of the equation are the costs of adding the bright-line Jackson rule on top of Edwards and other extant protections.  The principal cost of applying any exclusionary rule \u201cis, of course, letting guilty and possibly dangerous criminals go free \u2026\u00a0.\u201d  Herring v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).  Jackson not only \u201coperates to invalidate a confession given by the free choice of suspects who have received proper advice of their Miranda rights but waived them nonetheless,\u201d Cobb, supra, at 174\u2013175 (Kennedy, J., concurring), but also deters law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain voluntary confessions.  The \u201cready ability to obtain uncoerced confessions is not an evil but an unmitigated good.\u201d  McNeil, 501 U. S., at 181.  Without these confessions, crimes go unsolved and criminals unpunished.  These are not negligible costs, and in our view the Jackson Court gave them too short shrift.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding this calculus, Montejo and his amici urge the retention of Jackson.  Their principal objection to its elimination is that the Edwards regime which remains will not provide an administrable rule.  But this Court has praised Edwards precisely because it provides \u201c\u00a0\u2018clear and unequivocal\u2019 guidelines to the law enforcement profession,\u201d Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682 (1988).  Our cases make clear which sorts of statements trigger its protections, see Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), and once triggered, the rule operates as a bright line.  Montejo expresses concern that courts will have to determine whether statements made at preliminary hearings constitute Edwards invocations\u2014thus implicating all the practical problems of the Louisiana rule we discussed above, see Part II, supra.  That concern is misguided.  \u201cWe have in fact never held that a person can invoke his Miranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019\u2026\u00a0.\u201d  McNeil, supra, at 182, n.\u00a03.  What matters for Miranda and Edwards is what happens when the defendant is approached for interrogation, and (if he consents) what happens during the interrogation\u2014not what happened at any preliminary hearing.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, when the marginal benefits of the Jackson rule are weighed against its substantial costs to the truth-seeking process and the criminal justice system, we readily conclude that the rule does not \u201cpay its way,\u201d United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907\u2013908, n.\u00a06 (1984).  Michigan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled.\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although our holding means that the Louisiana Supreme Court correctly rejected Montejo\u2019s claim under Jackson, we think that Montejo should be given an opportunity to contend that his letter of apology should still have been suppressed under the rule of Edwards.  If Montejo made a clear assertion of the right to counsel when the officers approached him about accompanying them on the excursion for the murder weapon, then no interrogation should have taken place unless Montejo initiated it.  Davis, supra, at 459.  Even if Montejo subsequently agreed to waive his rights, that waiver would have been invalid had it followed an \u201cunequivocal election of the right,\u201d Cobb, 532 U. S., at 176 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montejo understandably did not pursue an Edwards objection, because Jackson served as the Sixth Amendment analogy to Edwards and offered broader protections.  Our decision today, overruling Jackson, changes the legal landscape and does so in part based on the protections already provided by Edwards.  Thus we think that a remand is appropriate so that Montejo can pursue this alternative avenue for relief.  Montejo may also seek on remand to press any claim he might have that his Sixth Amendment waiver was not knowing and voluntary, e.g., his argument that the waiver was invalid because it was based on misrepresentations by police as to whether he had been appointed a lawyer, cf. Moran, 475 U. S., at 428\u2013429.  These matters have heightened importance in light of our opinion today.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not venture to resolve these issues ourselves, not only because we are a court of final review, \u201cnot of first view,\u201d  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005), but also because the relevant facts remain unclear.  Montejo and the police gave inconsistent testimony about exactly what took place on the afternoon of September 10, 2002, and the Louisiana Supreme Court did not make an explicit credibility determination.  Moreover, Montejo\u2019s testimony came not at the suppression hearing, but rather only at trial, and we are unsure whether under state law that testimony came too late to affect the propriety of the admission of the evidence.  These matters are best left for resolution on remand.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do reject, however, the dissent\u2019s revisionist legal analysis of the \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d issue.  Post, at 10\u201314.  In determining whether a Sixth Amendment waiver was knowing and voluntary, there is no reason categorically to distinguish an unrepresented defendant from a represented one.  It is equally true for each that, as we held in Patterson, the Miranda warnings adequately inform him \u201cof his right to have counsel present during the questioning,\u201d and make him \u201caware of the consequences of a decision by him to waive his Sixth Amendment rights,\u201d 487 U. S., at 293.  Somewhat surprisingly for an opinion that extols the virtues of stare decisis, the dissent complains that our \u201ctreatment of the waiver question rests entirely on the dubious decision in Patterson,\u201d post, at 12.  The Court in Patterson did not consider the result dubious, nor does the Court today.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is an exemplar of Justice Jackson\u2019s oft quoted warning that this Court \u201cis forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.\u201d  Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157, 181 (1943) (opinion concurring in result).  We today remove Michigan v. Jackson\u2019s fourth story of prophylaxis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u201cThe sheriff or law enforcement officer having custody of an arrested person shall bring him promptly, and in any case within seventy-two hours from the time of the arrest, before a judge for the purpose of appointment of counsel.\u201d  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 230.1(A) (West Supp. 2009).\n\u00a0The dissent responds that Jackson also ensures that the defendant\u2019s counsel receives notice of any interrogation, post, at 6, n.\u00a02.  \nBut notice to what end?  Surely not in order to protect some constitutional right to receive counsel\u2019s advice regarding waiver of the right to have counsel present.  Contrary to the dissent\u2019s intimations, neither the advice nor the presence of counsel is needed in order to effectuate a knowing waiver of the Sixth Amendment right.  Our cases make clear that the Miranda waivers typically suffice; indeed, even an unrepresented defendant can waive his right to counsel.  See supra, at 7.\n\u00a0In the cited passage, the Court noted that \u201c[o]nce an accused has a lawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving the sanctity of attorney-client relationship takes effect.\u201d  Patterson, 487 U. S., at 290, n.\u00a03.  To support that proposition, the Court cited Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985), which was not a case about waiver.  The passage went on to observe that \u201cthe analysis changes markedly once an accused even requests the assistance of counsel,\u201d 487 U. S., at 290, n.\u00a03 (emphasis in original), this time citing Jackson.  Montejo infers from the \u201ceven requests\u201d that having counsel is more conclusive of the invalidity of uncounseled waiver than the mere requesting of counsel.  But the Patterson footnote did not suggest that the analysis \u201cchanges\u201d in both these scenarios (having a lawyer, versus requesting one) with specific reference to the validity of waivers under the Sixth Amendment.  The citation of Moulton (a nonwaiver case) for the first scenario suggests just the opposite.\n\u00a0The dissent posits a different reliance interest: \u201cthe public\u2019s interest in knowing that counsel, once secured, may be reasonably relied upon as a medium between the accused and the power of the State,\u201d post, at 9.  We suspect the public would be surprised to learn that a criminal can freely sign away his right to a lawyer, confess his crimes, and then ask the courts to assume that the confession was coerced\u2014on the ground that he had, at some earlier point in time, made a pro forma statement requesting that counsel be appointed on his behalf.\n\u00a0The dissent claims that, in fact, few confessions have been suppressed by federal courts applying Jackson.  Post, at 8.  If so, that is because, as the dissent boasts, \u201cgenerations of police officers have been trained to refrain from approaching represented defendants,\u201d post, at 9, n.\u00a04.  Anyway, if the rule truly does not hinder law enforcement or make much practical difference, see post, at 7\u20139, and nn.\u00a03\u20134, then there is no reason to be particularly exercised about its demise."}], "related_cases": null, "justia_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/556/778/"}, {"ID": 55601, "name": "Herring v.

The warrant, still active in the neighboring Dale County Sheriff's Office, was supposed to have been recalled five months prior, however someone had accidentally failed to remove it from the computer system.

Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority held that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) did not expressly or impliedly preempt all claims related to \"smoking and health\" under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA). Adopting the reasoning it used in <em>Cipollone</em>, the court found that claims based on a common law legal duty (\"predicate-duty\" approach), like a manufacturer's duty not to misrepresent its products, were not preempted simply because they related to cigarette manufacturers and the labeling of its products.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin G. Scalia, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented. Justice Thomas disagreed with the majority's adoption of the \"predicate-duty\" approach from <em>Cipollone</em> arguing it was confusing and unworkable. Rather, he argued that the Court should adopt a clear test that expressly pre-empts any state law claim that \"imposes an obligation\u2026because of the effect of smoking upon health.\"</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 43165, "name": "Theodore B.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992).  As in that case, the question before us is whether state-law claims alleging that cigarette manufacturers misled the public about the health effects of cigarettes are pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended in 1969 (Labeling Act or Act).  The Labeling Act requires that specific health warnings be placed on all cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333, in order to eliminate \u201cdiverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,\u201d \u00a71331.  To that end, \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act pre-empts any \u201crequirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \u2026 imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.\u201d  \u00a71334(b).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether \u00a75(b) pre-empts state common-law claims divided the Court in Cipollone.  The plurality opinion found some claims expressly pre-empted and others not, depending on whether \u201cthe legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \u2026 imposed under State law with respect to \u2026 advertising or promotion.\u201d  505 U. S., at 524 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  A majority of the Court disagreed with the plurality\u2019s predicate-duty approach.  Id., at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 552\u2013554 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  In particular, Justice Scalia recognized that the plurality\u2019s interpretation of \u00a75(b) created an unworkable test for pre-emption with little or no relationship to the text of the statute.  Id., at 544, 555\u2013556.  The intervening years have vindicated Justice Scalia\u2019s critical assessment; the lower courts have consistently expressed frustration at the difficulty in applying the Cipollone plurality\u2019s test.  Moreover, this Court\u2019s recent pre-emption decisions have undermined, and in some cases overruled, central aspects of the plurality\u2019s atextual approach to express pre-emption generally, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and to \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act specifically, Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525 (2001).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority today ignores these problems and adopts the methodology of the Cipollone plurality as governing law.  As a consequence, the majority concludes that state-law liability for deceiving purchasers about the health effects of smoking light cigarettes is not a \u201crequirement or prohibition based on smoking and health\u201d under the Labeling Act.  The Court\u2019s fidelity to Cipollone is unwise and unnecessary.  The Court should instead provide the lower courts with a clear test that advances Congress\u2019 stated goals by interpreting \u00a75(b) to expressly pre-empt any claim that \u201cimposes an obligation \u2026 because of the effect of smoking upon health.\u201d  Cipollone, supra, at 554 (opinion of Scalia, J.).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents\u2019 lawsuit under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207 (Supp. 2008), is expressly pre-empted under \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.  The civil action is premised on the allegation that the cigarette manufacturers misled respondents into believing that smoking light cigarettes would be healthier for them than smoking regular cigarettes.  A judgment in respondents\u2019 favor will thus result in a \u201crequirement\u201d that petitioners represent the effects of smoking on health in a particular way in their advertising and promotion of light cigarettes.  Because liability in this case is thereby premised on the effect of smoking on health, I would hold that respondents\u2019 state-law claims are expressly pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Cipollone, a smoker and her spouse brought state common-law claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn against cigarette manufacturers for their alleged failure to adequately disclose the health risks of smoking.  505 U. S., at 509.  As here, the cigarette manufacturer asserted that the claims were pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In deciding the case, the Court could not agree on the meaning of the Labeling Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision.  It produced three separate opinions, none of which reflected the views of a majority of Justices.  Relying heavily on a \u201cpresumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations,\u201d a plurality opinion by Justice Stevens settled on a \u201cnarrow reading\u201d of the Labeling Act that tested \u00a75(b)\u2019s pre-emptive effect under a claim-by-claim approach.  Id., at 524.  This approach considered each state-law claim and asked whether it is predicated \u201con a duty \u2018based on smoking and health.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 528; see also id., at 524.  If so, the claim is pre-empted.  Id., at 524, 528. If, however, the claim is predicated on a \u201cmore general obligation\u201d under state law, it may proceed.  Id., at 528\u2013529.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying a test that it conceded lacked \u201ctheoretical elegance,\u201d id., at 530, n.\u00a027, the plurality held that the failure-to-warn claims were pre-empted \u201cto the extent that those claims rel[ied] on omissions or inclusions in \u2026 advertising or promotions\u201d of cigarettes.  Id., at 531.  The same was true for one of the fraud claims, which alleged that the cigarette manufacturers had used their advertising to neutralize the federally required warning labels.  Id., at 527\u2013528.  The plurality determined that these claims were \u201cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements \u2026 that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking.\u201d  Id., at 527.  Thus, according to the plurality, these state-law claims sought recovery under the theory that the cigarette manufacturer breached a duty based on smoking or health.  But the plurality found that the other fraud claim, which alleged misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, was not pre-empted because it was based on a more general state-law obligation: \u201cthe duty not to deceive.\u201d  Id., at 528\u2013529.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Blackmun, writing for three Justices, departed from the plurality on the antecedent question whether the Labeling Act pre-empted state common-law damages claims at all.  Id., at 535\u2013542 (opinion, joined by Kennedy and Souter, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).  He concluded that the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018State law\u2019\u00a0\u201d in \u00a75(b) referred only to \u201cpositive enactments such as statutes and regulations.\u201d  Id., at 535.  But Justice Blackmun specifically noted that even if state common-law claims were within the scope of the Labeling Act, he could not join the plurality\u2019s claim-by-claim approach because he \u201cperceive[d] no principled basis for many of the plurality\u2019s asserted distinctions among the common-law claims.\u201d  Id., at 543.  Justice Blackmun wrote that Congress could not have \u201cintended to create such a hodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it amended the pre-emption provision in 1970,\u201d and lamented the \u201cdifficulty lower courts w[ould] encounter in attempting to implement\u201d the plurality\u2019s test.  Id., at 543\u2013544.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Scalia, writing for two Justices, also faulted the plurality for its claim-by-claim approach.  Id., at 544\u2013556 (opinion, joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Although he agreed with the plurality that the phrase \u201c\u00a0\u2018State law\u2019\u00a0\u201d in \u00a75(b) encompassed state common-law claims as well as state statutes and regulations, id., at 548\u2013549, Justice Scalia objected to the plurality\u2019s invocation of a presumption against pre-emption to narrowly interpret \u00a75(b), id., at 544, 545\u2013547.  Because Congress had expressed its intent to pre-empt state law by enacting \u00a75(b), the Court\u2019s \u201cresponsibility [was] to apply to the text ordinary principles of statutory construction.\u201d  Id., at 545.[Footnote 1]  By employing its \u201cnewly crafted doctrine of narrow construction,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote, the plurality arrived at a cramped and unnatural construction of \u00a75(b) that failed to give effect to the statutory text.  Id., at 544\u2013548.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying \u201cordinary principles\u201d of statutory construction, id., at 548, Justice Scalia determined that the proper test for pre-emption of state-law claims under \u00a75(b) was far less complicated than the plurality\u2019s claim-by-claim approach.  As he explained, \u201c[o]nce one is forced to select a consistent methodology for evaluating whether a given legal duty is \u2018based on smoking and health,\u2019 it becomes obvious that the methodology must focus not upon the ultimate source of the duty \u2026 but upon its proximate application.\u201d  Id., at 553.  This \u201cproximate application\u201d test, therefore, focuses not on the state-law duty invoked by the plaintiff, but on the effect of the suit on the cigarette manufacturer\u2019s conduct\u2014i.e., the \u201crequirement\u201d or \u201cprohibition\u201d that would be imposed under state law.  Put simply, if, \u201cwhatever the source of the duty, [the claim] imposes an obligation \u2026 because of the effect of smoking upon health,\u201d it is pre-empted.  Id., at 554; see also id., at 555 (\u201cThe test for pre-emption in this setting should be one of practical compulsion, i.e., whether the law practically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior that Congress has barred the States from prescribing directly\u201d).  Justice Scalia also seconded Justice Blackmun\u2019s concern that the lower courts would find the plurality\u2019s distinctions between materially identical state-law claims to be incapable of application: \u201cA disposition that raises more questions than it answers does not serve the country well.\u201d  Id., at 556.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sixteen years later, we must confront Cipollone to resolve the question presented in this case: whether respondents\u2019 class-action claims for fraudulent marketing under the MUTPA are pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.  The majority adheres to Cipollone because it \u201cremain[s] persuaded\u201d that the plurality\u2019s construction of the \u00a75(b) was \u201c\u00a0\u2018fair.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 13\u201314.  I disagree.  The Court should discard the Cipollone plurality\u2019s ill-conceived predicate-duty approach and replace it with Justice Scalia\u2019s far more workable and textually sound \u201cproximate application\u201d test.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority does not assert that the Cipollone plurality opinion is binding precedent, and rightly so.  Because the \u201cplurality opinion \u2026 did not represent the views of a majority of the Court, we are not bound by its reasoning.\u201d  CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69, 81 (1987) (footnote omitted).  At most, Cipollone is a \u201cpoint of reference for further discussion.\u201d  Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730, 737 (1983) (plurality opinion).  But even if the plurality opinion had some force beyond its mere persuasive value, it nevertheless should be abandoned.  It is unworkable; it has been overtaken by more recent decisions of this Court; and it cannot be reconciled with a commonsense reading of the text of \u00a75(b).\nA\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As predicted by a majority of the Justices in Cipollone, the plurality opinion\u2019s claim-by-claim approach has proved unworkable in the lower federal courts and state courts.  The District Court in this case properly observed that \u201ccourts remain divided about what the decision means and how to apply it\u201d and that \u201cCipollone\u2019s distinctions, though clear in theory, defy clear application.\u201d  436 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 132, 142 (Me. 2006).  Other courts have expressed similar frustration with the Cipollone framework.  See, e.g., Glassner v. R.\u00a0J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 223 F.\u00a03d 343, 348 (CA6 2000) (\u201cApplying the plurality opinion in Cipollone to the Complaint in the present case is no easy task\u201d); Huddleston v. R.\u00a0J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 66 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 1370, 1380 (ND Ga. 1999) (\u201cIt would be an understatement to say that it is difficult to apply the plurality opinion in Cipollone to the Amended Complaint in this case.  It is an impossibility\u201d); In\u00a0re Welding Fume Prods. Liability Litigation, 364 F. Supp. 2d 669, 681, n.\u00a013 (ND Ohio 2005) (\u201c[I]n Cipollone, the Supreme Court \u2026 delivered a fractured plurality opinion that is not easy to comprehend\u201d); Whiteley v. Philip Morris, Inc., 117 Cal. App. 4th 635, 670, 11 Cal. Rptr. 3d 807, 835\u2013836 (2004) (\u201c[Cipollone is] \u2018difficult\u2019 \u2026 due to the inherent contradiction at the core of the case\u201d); Mangini v. R.\u00a0J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 232, 244 (Cal. App. 1993) (\u201cCipollone draws no bright lines amenable to easy application\u201d), aff\u2019d, 7 Cal. 4th 1057, 875 P.\u00a02d 73 (1994).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court should not retain an interpretative test that has proved incapable of implementation.  \u201c[T]he mischievous consequences to litigants and courts alike from the perpetuation of an unworkable rule are too great.\u201d  Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 20) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cStare decisis considerations carry little weight when an erroneous \u2018governing decisio[n]\u2019 has created an \u2018unworkable\u2019 legal regime\u201d (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991)).  We owe far more to the lower courts, which depend on this Court\u2019s guidance, and to litigants, who must conform their actions to the Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law.  The Cipollone plurality\u2019s test for pre-emption under \u00a75(b) should be abandoned for this reason alone.\nB\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the years since Cipollone was decided, this Court has altered its doctrinal approach to express pre-emption.  The Cipollone plurality justified what it described as the \u201ctheoretical [in]elegance\u201d of its construction of \u00a75(b) by relying on the presumption against pre-emption, which, it argued, required a narrow, but \u201cfair,\u201d construction of the statute.  505 U. S., at 530, n.\u00a027.  See, e.g., id., at 518 (majority opinion) (\u201cThis presumption reinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of \u00a75\u201d); id., at 523 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[W]e must \u2026 narrowly construe the precise language of \u00a75(b)\u201d); id., at 524 (\u00a75(b) must be given \u201ca fair but narrow reading\u201d); id., at 529 (\u201c[W]e conclude that the phrase \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements\u201d).  Of course, as Justice Scalia explained, there was nothing \u201cfair\u201d about imposing an artificially narrow construction on the Labeling Act\u2019s pre-emption provision. See id., at 545 (explaining that the presumption against pre-emption \u201cdissolves once there is conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute itself\u00a0\u201d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Cipollone, the Court\u2019s reliance on the presumption against pre-emption has waned in the express pre-emption context.  In 2002, for example, the Court unanimously explained that the \u201ctask of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the [express pre-emption] clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress\u2019 pre-emptive intent.\u201d  Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 62\u201363 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Without referring to any presumption against pre-emption, the Court decided that the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971\u2019s express pre-emption provision did not pre-empt state-law claims.  Id., at 62\u201364.  Most other decisions since Cipollone also have refrained from invoking the presumption in the context of express pre-emption. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004); Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001); United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89 (2000); Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has invoked the presumption sporadically during this time frame.  As the majority notes, ante, at 5, Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470 (1996), applied the presumption against pre-emption in deciding that the federal manufacturing and labeling requirements of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) did not pre-empt state common-law claims.  Id., at 500\u2013501.  Like Cipollone before it, Lohr produced a fractured decision featuring three opinions.  518 U. S., at 474 (opinion of Stevens, J.), id., at 503 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), id., at 509 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And, like Cipollone, Lohr\u2019s approach to express pre-emption predates the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence on the topic.  In fact, this Court last year revisited the pre-emption provision of the MDA, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a)(1), and did not employ any presumption against pre-emption.  Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  See infra, at 11-13.[Footnote 2]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More recently, in Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, a case revisiting the meaning of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act, the Court briefly alluded to the presumption, but did not rely on it to reach its decision.  See id., at 541\u2013542, 546\u2013551.  Indeed, the Court\u2019s cursory treatment of the presumption in Reilly stands in stark contrast to the First Circuit decision it reversed; the First Circuit relied heavily on the \u201cfull force\u201d of the presumption to determine that the regulations at issue were not pre-empted.  See Consolidated Cigar Corp. v. Reilly, 218 F.\u00a03d 30, 38\u201341 (2000).  This Court, in overturning that judgment, declined to employ the presumption in its construction of \u00a75(b).  See Reilly, 533 U. S., at 546\u2013551.  Justice Stevens highlighted this very point in dissent, arguing that if the presumption had been faithfully applied, the result would have been different.  Id., at 591\u2013593.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also relies on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), where the presumption was again mentioned, but only in dicta.  As in Reilly, the presumption did not drive the Court\u2019s construction of the statute at issue.  544 U. S., at 449 (explaining that the presumption meant just that the holding of no pre-emption would have been the same \u201ceven if [respondent\u2019s] alternative [construction of the statute] were just as plausible as our reading of the text\u201d); see also id., at 457 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing that the case should be vacated and remanded and reiterating that the \u201cpresumption does not apply \u2026 when Congress has included within a statute an express pre-emption provision\u201d).  At bottom, although the Court\u2019s treatment of the presumption against pre-emption has not been uniform, the Court\u2019s express pre-emption cases since Cipollone have marked a retreat from reliance on it to distort the statutory text.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If any doubt remained, it was eliminated last Term in Riegel.  The question in Riegel, as noted above, was whether the MDA expressly pre-empts state common-law claims \u201cchallenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Over the dissent of one Justice, the Court held that the state-law claims were pre-empted because the requirements the plaintiffs sought to impose were \u201c\u00a0\u2018different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable \u2026 to the device\u2019\u00a0\u201d under federal law.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a)(1)).  The Court interpreted the statute without reference to the presumption or any perceived need to impose a narrow construction on the provision in order to protect the police power of the States.  Rather, the Court simply construed the MDA in accordance with ordinary principles of statutory construction.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not accidental.  The dissent focused on the Court\u2019s refusal to invoke the presumption in order to save the state-law claims from pre-emption.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at ___) (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  The dissent was adamant that \u201c[f]ederal laws containing a preemption clause do not automatically escape the presumption against pre-emption.\u201d  Ibid. (slip op., at 2\u20133); id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (\u201cWhere the text of a pre-emption clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Bates, supra, at 449)).  In accordance with the presumption, the dissent would have found the state-law claims under review to fall beyond the reach of the MDA\u2019s express pre-emption provision.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at ___); see also id., at ___, n.\u00a08 (slip op., at 6, n.\u00a08); id., at ___, n.\u00a09 (slip op., at 7, n.\u00a09) (rejecting the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7360(d) because \u201cthe presumption against pre-emption [is] operative even in construing a preemption clause\u201d).  Given the dissent\u2019s clear call for the use of the presumption against pre-emption, the Court\u2019s decision not to invoke it was necessarily a rejection of any role for the presumption in construing the statute.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Stevens also declined to invoke the presumption in his opinion.  Id., at ___ (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In his view, the \u201csignificance of the pre-emption provision in the [MDA] was not fully appreciated until many years after it was enacted\u201d and, therefore, it is \u201ca statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors.\u201d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  But Justice Stevens\u2019 opinion in Riegel\u2014unlike the majority opinion here, the plurality opinion in Cipollone, and the dissenting opinion in Riegel\u2014did not invoke the presumption to bend the text of the statute to meet the perceived purpose of Congress.  Instead, Justice Stevens correctly found that \u201c\u00a0\u2018it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380 (1998)).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of Riegel, there is no authority for invoking the presumption against pre-emption in express pre-emption cases.  The majority here thus turns to Lohr to revive the presumption and, in turn, to justify its restrictive reading of the Labeling Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision.  But, as Riegel plainly shows, the Court is no longer willing to unreasonably interpret expressly pre-emptive federal laws in the name of \u201c\u00a0\u2018congressional purpose,\u2019\u00a0\u201d ante, at 14, or because \u201cCongress has legislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States,\u201d ante, at 5.  The text  of the statute must control.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Riegel also undermined Cipollone in an even more fundamental way: It conclusively decided that a common-law cause of action imposes a state-law \u201c\u00a0\u2018requiremen[t]\u2019\u00a0\u201d that may be pre-empted by federal law.  552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\u201cAbsent other indication, reference to a State\u2019s \u2018requirements\u2019 includes its common-law duties . . . . Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation [than regulatory legislation]\u201d).  Justice Blackmun\u2019s contrary interpretation of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act in Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 538\u2013539 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), which provided the votes necessary for the judgment, thus is no longer tenable.  In light of Riegel\u2019s rejection of the presumption against pre-emption relied on by the plurality, as well as the definition of \u201crequirements\u201d relied on in Justice Blackmun\u2019s concurring opinion, Cipollone\u2019s approach to express pre-emption is nothing more than \u201ca remnant of abandoned doctrine.\u201d  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 855 (1992).\nC\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cipollone plurality\u2019s reading of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act was further undermined by this Court\u2019s decision in Reilly, 533 U. S. 525.  There, the Court confronted regulations imposed by the Massachusetts attorney general on the location of tobacco advertising pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s unfair trade practices statute.  Id., at 533\u2013536.  The Court found the regulations\u2014to the extent they applied to cigarettes\u2014expressly pre-empted because, although Massachusetts remained free to enact \u201cgenerally applicable zoning restrictions,\u201d its imposition of \u201cspecial requirements or prohibitions \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 \u2018with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes\u2019\u00a0\u201d fell within the ambit of \u00a75(b)\u2019s pre-emptive sweep.  Id., at 551.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reilly did not ignore Cipollone.  It cited the plurality opinion extensively in its discussion of the basic history and text of the Labeling Act.  533 U. S., at 540\u2013546.  But in analyzing whether the regulations enacted by the Massachusetts attorney general were expressly pre-empted, the Court was silent about Cipollone.  533 U. S., at 546\u2013551. Unlike the District Court, which saw \u201cthe central question for purposes of pre-emption [as] whether the regulations create[d] a predicate legal duty based on smoking and health,\u201d id., at 537, the Court\u2019s substantive examination of the regulations under \u00a75(b) included no mention of the Cipollone plurality\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d test.  See 533 U. S., at 546\u2013551.  Instead, the Court disagreed with \u201cthe Attorney General\u2019s narrow construction\u201d of the statute\u2019s \u201c\u00a0\u2018based on smoking and health\u2019\u00a0\u201d language, and concluded that the regulations were pre-empted because they were \u201cmotivated by\u201d and \u201cintertwined with\u201d the concerns about smoking and health.  Id., at 547\u2013548.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reilly, therefore, cannot be reconciled with the Cipollone plurality\u2019s interpretation of \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.  The regulations at issue in Reilly were enacted to implement a Massachusetts state law imposing a duty against unfair and deceptive trade practices\u2014the same predicate duty asserted under the MUTPA in this case.  533 U. S., at 533.  The state-law duty at issue in Reilly was no less general than the state-law duty at issue in this case or the state-law fraud claims confronted in Cipollone.  Compare Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\u00a093A, \u00a72(a) (West 1996) (\u201cUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful\u201d), with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207 (Supp. 2008) (\u201cUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are declared unlawful\u201d), and Cipollone, supra, at 528 (explaining that the \u201cpredicate\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation claim was \u201ca state-law duty not to make false statements of material fact or to conceal such facts\u201d).  Faithful application of the Cipollone plurality opinion, therefore, would have required the Court in Reilly to uphold the regulations.  Indeed, Justice Stevens argued as much in his dissent.  533 U. S., at 597 (noting that \u201c[n]ary a word in any of the three Cipollone opinions supports the thesis that \u00a75 should be interpreted to pre-empt state regulation of the location of signs advertising cigarettes\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, the majority today finds that Reilly and Cipollone are perfectly compatible.  It contends that, although the regulations in question in Reilly \u201cderived from a general deceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this case,\u201d they were pre-empted because they \u201ctargeted advertising that tended to promote tobacco use by children instead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.\u201d  Ante, at 12.  According to the majority, that legal duty contrasts with the regulations here, as \u201c[t]he MUTPA says nothing about either \u2018smoking\u2019 or \u2018health.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Ante, at 13; see also ante, at 10.  But the Cipollone plurality expressly rejected any distinction between targeted regulations like those in Reilly and general duties imposed by the common law.  505 U. S., at 522.  In fact, the general duties underlying the failure-to-warn and warning-neutralization claims in Cipollone\u2014which the plurality found to be pre-empted\u2014say nothing about smoking and health.  Id., at 524; see also id., at 553 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the duty to warn about a product\u2019s dangers was not \u201cspecifically crafted with an eye toward \u2018smoking and health\u2019\u00a0\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Reilly is better understood as establishing that even a general duty can impose requirements or prohibitions based on smoking and health.  Reilly weakened the force of the Cipollone plurality\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d approach to the pre-emptive effect of \u00a75(b) and cast doubt on its continuing utility.\nD\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Cipollone plurality\u2019s approach should be discarded because its \u201cpredicate duty\u201d approach is unpersuasive as an initial matter.  In considering the warning-neutralization claim, for example, the Cipollone plurality asserted that the claim is predicated on a state-law prohibition against minimizing the health risks associated with smoking.  505 U. S., at 527.  The Court today reaffirms this view.  Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 13 (describing \u00a75(b) as expressly pre-empting \u201crules \u2026 that are based on smoking and health\u201d).  But every products liability action, including a failure-to-warn action, applies generally to all products.  See Cipollone, supra, at 553 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Thus, the \u201cduty\u201d or \u201crule\u201d involved in a failure-to-warn claim is no more specific to smoking and health than is a common-law fraud claim based on the \u201cduty\u201d or \u201crule\u201d not to use deceptive or misleading trade practices.  Yet only for the latter was the Cipollone plurality content to ignore the context in which the claim is asserted.  This shifting level of generality was identified as a logical weakness in the original Cipollone plurality decision by a majority of the Court, 505 U. S., at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 553\u2013554 (opinion of Scalia, J.), and it remains equally unconvincing today.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is therefore unsurprising that the Court\u2019s defense of the plurality\u2019s confusing test is confined to one sentence and a footnote.  See ante, at 13\u201314 (\u201cWhile we again acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack \u2018theoretical elegance,\u2019 we remain persuaded that it represents \u2018a fair understanding of congressional purpose\u2019\u00a0\u201d (quoting Cipollone, supra, at 529\u2013530, n.\u00a027)); ante, at 10, n.\u00a07.  The majority instead argues that this approach \u201cfails to explain why Congress would . . . permi[t] cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent advertising.\u201d  Ante, at 10, n.\u00a07.  But no explanation is necessary; the text speaks for itself.  Congress has pre-empted only those claims that would impose \u201crequirement[s] or prohibition[s] based on smoking and health.\u201d  15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(b).  Thus, if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely advertise their products as \u201cAmerican-made,\u201d or \u201cthe official cigarette of Major League Baseball,\u201d state-law claims arising from that wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, contrary to the majority\u2019s policy arguments, faithful application of the statutory language does not authorize fraudulent advertising with respect to smoking and health.[Footnote 3]  Any misleading promotional statements for cigarettes remain subject to federal regulatory oversight under the Labeling Act.  See \u00a71336.  The relevant question thus is not whether \u201cpetitioners will be prohibited from selling as \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018low tar\u2019 only those cigarettes that are not actually light and do not actually deliver less tar and nicotine.\u201d Ante, at 12, n.\u00a010.  Rather, the issue is whether the Labeling Act allows regulators and juries to decide, on a state-by-state basis, whether petitioners\u2019 light and low-tar descriptors were in fact fraudulent, or instead whether \u00a75(b) charged the Federal Government with reaching a comprehensive judgment with respect to this question.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress chose a uniform federal standard.  Under the Labeling Act, Congress \u201cestablish[ed] a comprehensive Federal Program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising,\u201d 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331, so that \u201ccommerce and the national economy may . . . not [be] impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,\u201d \u00a71331(2)(B).[Footnote 4]  The majority\u2019s distorted interpretation of \u00a75(b) defeats this express congressional purpose, opening the door to an untold number of deceptive-practices lawsuits across the country.  The question whether marketing a light cigarette is \u201c\u00a0\u2018misrepresentative\u2019\u00a0\u201d in light of compensatory behavior \u201cwould almost certainly be answered differently from State to State.\u201d  Cipollone, supra, 505 U. S., at 553 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  This will inevitably result in the nonuniform imposition of liability for the marketing of light and/or low-tar cigarettes\u2014the precise problem that Congress intended \u00a75(b) to remedy.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these serious flaws in the majority\u2019s approach, even if the Cipollone plurality opinion were binding precedent, the Court \u201cshould not hesitate to allow our precedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Congress when our statutory precedent is \u2018unworkable\u2019 or \u2018badly reasoned.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 402 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 936 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), in turn quoting Payne, 501 U. S., at 827 (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  Where, as here, there is \u201cconfusion following a splintered decision,\u201d that \u201cis itself a reason for reexamining that decision.\u201d  Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994).  When a decision of this Court has failed to properly interpret a statute, we should not \u201cplace on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court\u2019s own error.\u201d  Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69\u201370 (1946).[Footnote 5]\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying the proper test\u2014i.e., whether a jury verdict on respondents\u2019 claims would \u201cimpos[e] an obligation\u201d on the cigarette manufacturer \u201cbecause of the effect of smoking upon health,\u201d Cipollone, supra, at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), respondents\u2019 state-law claims are expressly pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.  Respondents, longtime smokers of Marlboro Lights, claim that they have suffered an injury as a result of petitioners\u2019 decision to advertise these cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d and/or \u201clow-tar and low nicotine products.\u201d  436 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 144\u2013145.  They claim that petitioners marketed their cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d and/or \u201clow-tar and low-nicotine products\u201d despite knowledge that light-cigarette smokers would engage in compensatory behavior causing them to inhale at least as much tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes.  Ibid.  Respondents thus allege that they were misled into thinking that they were gaining a health advantage by smoking the light cigarettes, ibid., and, as a result, petitioners\u2019 conduct was an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d under the MUTPA.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207; 436 F. Supp. 2d, at 133.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents\u2019 claims seek to impose liability on petitioners because of the effect that smoking light cigarettes had on their health.  The alleged misrepresentation here\u2014that \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow-tar\u201d cigarettes are not as healthy as advertised\u2014is actionable only because of the effect that smoking light and low-tar cigarettes had on respondents\u2019 health.  Otherwise, any alleged misrepresentation about the effect of the cigarettes on health would be immaterial for purposes of the MUTPA and would not be the source of the injuries that provided the impetus for the class-action lawsuit.  See State v. Weinschenk, 2005 ME 28, \u00b617, 868 A.\u00a02d 200, 206 (\u201cAn act or practice is deceptive [under the MUTPA] if it is a material representation, omission, act or practice that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances\u201d (emphasis added)).  Therefore, with this suit, respondents seek to require the cigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings about compensatory behavior, or to prohibit them from selling these products with the \u201clight\u201d or \u201clow-tar\u201d descriptors.  This is exactly the type of lawsuit that is pre-empted by the Labeling Act.  Cf.  Rowe, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (finding pre-emption of a Maine regulation of shipping of tobacco products where \u201c[t]he Maine law \u2026 produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the proper test for pre-emption is to look at the factual basis of a complaint to determine if a claim imposes a requirement based on smoking and health, there is no meaningful distinction to be drawn in this case between common-law failure-to-warn claims and claims under the MUTPA.[Footnote 6]  As the majority readily admits, both types of claims impose duties with respect to the same conduct\u2014i.e., the marketing of \u201clight,\u201d \u201clow-tar,\u201d and \u201clow-nicotine\u201d cigarettes.  See ante, at 11, n.\u00a09.  If the claims arise from identical conduct, the claims impose the same requirement or prohibition with respect to that conduct.  And when that allegedly wrongful conduct involves misleading statements about the health effects of smoking a particular brand of cigarette, the liability and resulting requirement or prohibition are, by definition, based on smoking and health.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, at oral argument, respondents argued that their claims do not impose requirements based on smoking and health because the damages they seek to recover are not based on the effect of smoking on their health; rather, respondents are \u201casking \u2026 for the difference in value between a product [they] thought [they] were buying and a product [they] actually bought.\u201d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  But the requirement or prohibition covered by \u00a75(b) is created by the imposition of liability for particular conduct\u2014here, the way in which petitioners marketed \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow-tar,\u201d and \u201clow-nicotine\u201d cigarettes\u2014not by the manner in which respondents have chosen to measure their damages.  No matter how respondents characterize their damages claim, they have not been injured for purposes of the MUTPA, and thus cannot recover, unless their decision to purchase the cigarettes had a negative effect on their health.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, respondents sought \u201csuch injunctive relief as may be appropriate\u201d in this case.  App. 42a.  The MUTPA specifically authorizes \u201cother equitable relief, including an injunction,\u201d to remedy unfair or deceptive trade practices.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7213(1) (West 2002).  And a court-crafted injunction prohibiting petitioners from marketing light cigarettes would be no less a requirement or prohibition than the regulations found to be pre-empted in Reilly.  In the end, no matter what form the remedy takes, the liability with respect to the specific claim still creates the requirement or prohibition.  When that liability is necessarily premised on the effects of smoking on health, as respondents\u2019 claims are here, the civil action is pre-empted by \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court today elects to convert the Cipollone plurality opinion into binding law, notwithstanding its weakened doctrinal foundation, its atextual construction of the statute, and the lower courts\u2019 inability to apply its methodology.  The resulting confusion about the nature of a claim\u2019s \u201cpredicate duty\u201d and inevitable disagreement in the lower courts as to what type of representations are \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d will have the perverse effect of increasing the nonuniformity of state regulation of cigarette advertising, the exact problem that Congress intended \u00a75(b) to remedy.  It may even force us to yet again revisit the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Labeling Act.  Because I believe that respondents\u2019 claims are pre-empted under \u00a75(b) of the Labeling Act, I respectfully dissent. \n\u00a0Justice Scalia also criticized the plurality for announcing a new rule that the enactment of an express pre-emption clause eliminates any consideration of implied pre-emption.  He explained that this new rule created mischief because, when combined with the presumption against pre-emption, it placed a heavy burden of exactitude on Congress when it wishes to say anything about pre-emption.  See Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 547\u2013548.   \n\u00a0Also, as in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), the fractured decision in Lohr was a source of confusion for the lower courts.  See Kemp v. Medtronic, Inc., 231 F.\u00a03d 216, 224 (CA6 2000) (\u201cThe various courts of appeals that have confronted issues of preemption arising under the MDA have struggled mightily with Lohr\u2019s language in an effort to discern its holding\u201d); see also Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., 254 F.\u00a03d 573, 579 (CA5 2001) (\u201cBecause only parts of Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion commanded a majority, extracting the final meaning of Lohr is no easy task. . . . Although Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence very specifically disavows the view that common law duties cannot provide substantive requirements for the purpose of preemption, neither his concurrence nor the plurality opinion offers much help to us in developing the point\u201d).  The confusion was cleared up in Riegel.  See infra, at 11\u201313.\n\u00a0The majority\u2019s policy-based attack could just as easily be leveled against its own determination that the Labeling Act pre-empts failure-to-warn claims.  But just as there is no basis in fact or law to contend that the Labeling Act encourages the marketing of hazardous products without adequate warning labels, ante, at 10, n. 8, there is no basis\nto contend that the text of the Labeling Act permits fraudulent\nadvertising.\n\u00a0The majority contends that the relatively constrained enforcement power of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1970 undermines any argument that Congress intended the Labeling Act to prevent States from regulating deceptive advertising and marketing of cigarettes.  Ante, at 8, n.\u00a06.  I am unwilling to rely on the majority\u2019s perception of the relative power of the FTC in 1970 to ignore Congress\u2019 stated purpose in enacting the Labeling Act and the plain meaning of the Act\u2019s express pre-emption provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0The United States, in its amicus brief and at oral argument, conspicuously declined to address express pre-emption or defend the Cipollone opinion\u2019s reasoning. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14\u201333.  Instead, it addressed only the question of implied pre-emption, an issue I do not reach because of my resolution of the question on express pre-emption.\n\u00a0The majority\u2019s observation that no warning-neutralization claim is at issue in this case, ante, at \u00a011 n.\u00a09, misses the point.  The principal weakness in the Cipollone plurality\u2019s logic is not its distinction between claims for warning neutralization and claims for fraud.  It is the fact that the predicate duty underlying New Jersey\u2019s products liability law, from which the majority now claims the warning-neutralization claim derived, see ante, at 11, n.\u00a08, was no more specific to smoking and health than the predicate duty underlying the fraud claim, see Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 552\u2013553 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (\u201cEach duty transcends the relationship between the cigarette companies and cigarette smokers; neither duty was specifically crafted with an eye toward \u2018smoking and health\u2019\u00a0\u201d); id., at 543 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also supra, at 16.  Thus, the products-liability and the fraud claims must stand or fall together.  The majority\u2019s refusal to address the logical inconsistency of its approach remains as glaring today as it was in Cipollone."}, {"id": 1788, "title": "Syllabus", "author": null, "type": {"value": "syllabus", "label": "Syllabus"}, "justia_opinion_id": 1962821, "justia_opinion_url": "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/70/", "judge_full_name": null, "judge_last_name": null, "title_overwrite": null, "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_document/written_opinion/1788", "justia_text": "ALTRIA GROUP, INC., et\u00a0al. v.

When the text of an express pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \u201caccept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\u201d  Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449.  The Labeling Act\u2019s stated purposes are to inform the public of the health risks of smoking while protecting commerce and the economy from the ill effects of nonuniform requirements to the extent consistent with the first goal.  Although fidelity to these purposes does not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question here is whether that result is nevertheless required by 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(b), which provides that \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\u201d  Pp.\u00a05\u20139.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Respondents\u2019 claim is not expressly pre-empted by \u00a71334(b).  As determined in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, the phrase \u201cbased on smoking and health\u201d modifies the state-law rule at issue rather than a particular application of that rule.  The Cipollone plurality concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed\u201d did not pre-empt the Cipollone plaintiff\u2019s common-law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepresented and concealed a material fact, because the claim alleged a violation of a duty not to deceive\u2014a duty that is not \u201cbased on\u201d smoking and health.  505 U. S., at 528\u2013529.  Respondents here also allege a violation of the duty not to deceive as codified in the MUTPA, which, like the common-law duty in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smoking and health.  Respondents\u2019 claim is not analogous to the \u201cwarning neutralization\u201d claim found to be pre-empted in Cipollone.  Reilly is consistent with Cipollone\u2019s analysis.  This Court disagrees with petitioners\u2019 alternative argument that the express pre-emption framework of Cipollone and Reilly should be rejected.  American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.

Specifically, they allege that petitioners\u2019 advertising fraudulently conveyed the message that their \u201clight\u201d cigarettes deliver less tar and nicotine to consumers than regular brands despite petitioners\u2019 knowledge that the message was untrue.  Petitioners deny the charge, asserting that their advertisements were factually accurate.  The merits of the dispute are not before us because the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of petitioners on the ground that respondents\u2019 state-law claim is pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended (Labeling Act).  The Court of Appeals reversed that judgment, and we granted certiorari to review its holding that the Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents\u2019 fraud claim.  We affirm.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents are Maine residents and longtime smokers of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes, which are manufactured by petitioners.  Invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court, respondents filed a complaint alleging that petitioners deliberately deceived them about the true and harmful nature of \u201clight\u201d cigarettes in violation of the MUTPA, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7207 (Supp. 2008).[Footnote 1]  Respondents claim that petitioners fraudulently marketed their cigarettes as being \u201clight\u201d and containing \u201c\u00a0\u2018[l]owered [t]ar and [n]icotine\u2019\u00a0\u201d to convey to consumers that they deliver less tar and nicotine and are therefore less harmful than regular cigarettes.  App. 28a\u201329a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents acknowledge that testing pursuant to the Cambridge Filter Method[Footnote 2] indicates that tar and nicotine yields of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights are lower than those of regular cigarettes.  Id., at 30a.  Respondents allege, however, that petitioners have known at all relevant times that human smokers unconsciously engage in compensatory behaviors not registered by Cambridge Filter Method testing that negate the effect of the tar- and nicotine-reducing features of \u201clight\u201d cigarettes.  Id., at 30a\u201331a.  By covering filter ventilation holes with their lips or fingers, taking larger or more frequent puffs, and holding the smoke in their lungs for a longer period of time, smokers of \u201clight\u201d cigarettes unknowingly inhale as much tar and nicotine as do smokers of regular cigarettes.  Ibid.  \u201cLight\u201d cigarettes are in fact more harmful because the increased ventilation that results from their unique design features produces smoke that is more mutagenic per milligram of tar than the smoke of regular cigarettes.  Id., at 31a\u201332a.  Respondents claim that petitioners violated the MUTPA by fraudulently concealing that information and by affirmatively representing, through the use of \u201clight\u201d and \u201clowered tar and nicotine\u201d descriptors, that their cigarettes would pose fewer health risks.  Id., at 32a, 33a.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Labeling Act, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(b), expressly pre-empts respondents\u2019 state-law cause of action.  Relying on our decisions in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525 (2001), the District Court concluded that respondents\u2019 MUTPA claim is pre-empted.  The court recast respondents\u2019 claim as a failure-to-warn or warning neutralization claim of the kind pre-empted in Cipollone: The claim charges petitioners with \u201cproduc[ing] a product it knew contained hidden risks \u2026 not apparent or known to the consumer\u201d\u2014a claim that \u201cruns to what [petitioners] actually said about Lights and what [respondents] claim they should have said.\u201d  436 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 132, 151 (Me. 2006).  And the difference between what petitioners said and what respondents would have them say is \u201c\u00a0\u2018intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  Id., at 153 (quoting Reilly, 533 U. S., at 548).  The District Court thus concluded that respondents\u2019 claim rests on a state-law requirement based on smoking and health of precisely the kind that \u00a71334(b) pre-empts, and it granted summary judgment for petitioners.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.  The Court of Appeals first rejected the District Court\u2019s characterization of respondents\u2019 claim as a warning neutralization claim akin to the pre-empted claim in Cipollone.  501 F.\u00a03d 29, 37, 40 (CA1 2007).  Instead, the court concluded that respondents\u2019 claim is in substance a fraud claim that alleges that petitioners falsely represented their cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d or having \u201clowered tar and nicotine\u201d even though they deliver to smokers the same quantities of those components as do regular cigarettes.  Id., at 36.  \u201cThe fact that these alleged misrepresentations were unaccompanied by additional statements in the nature of a warning does not transform the claimed fraud into failure to warn\u201d or warning neutralization.  Id., at 42\u201343.  Finding respondents\u2019 claim indistinguishable from the non-pre-empted fraud claim at issue in Cipollone, the Court of Appeals held that it is not expressly pre-empted.  The court also rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that respondents\u2019 claim is impliedly pre-empted because their success on that claim would stand as an obstacle to the purported policy of the FTC allowing the use of descriptive terms that convey Cambridge Filter Method test results.  Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In concluding that respondents\u2019 claim is not expressly pre-empted, the Court of Appeals considered and rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in a similar case.  501 F.\u00a03d, at 45.  Unlike the court below, the Fifth Circuit likened the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the use of \u201clight\u201d descriptors to Cipollone\u2019s warning neutralization claim and thus found it expressly pre-empted.  Brown v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 479 F.\u00a03d 383, 392\u2013393 (2007).  We granted the petition for certiorari to resolve this apparent conflict.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article VI, cl.\u00a02, of the Constitution provides that the laws of the United States \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d  Consistent with that command, we have long recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d  Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our inquiry into the scope of a statute\u2019s pre-emptive effect is guided by the rule that \u201c\u00a0\u2018[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every pre-emption case.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (quoting Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963)).  Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute\u2019s express language or through its structure and purpose.  See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977).  If a federal law contains an express pre-emption clause, it does not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope of Congress\u2019 displacement of state law still remains.  Pre-emptive intent may also be inferred if the scope of the statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy the legislative field, or if there is an actual conflict between state and federal law.  Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When addressing questions of express or implied pre-emption, we begin our analysis \u201cwith the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947).  That assumption applies with particular force when Congress has legislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States.  Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485; see also Reilly, 533 U. S., at 541\u2013542 (\u201cBecause \u2018federal law is said to bar state action in [a] fiel[d] of traditional state regulation,\u2019 namely, advertising, we \u2018wor[k] on the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [a]re not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u2019\u00a0\u201d (citation omitted)).  Thus, when the text of a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \u201caccept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\u201d  Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress enacted the Labeling Act in 1965[Footnote 3] in response to the Surgeon General\u2019s determination that cigarette smoking is harmful to health.  The Act required that every package of cigarettes sold in the United States contain a conspicuous warning, and it pre-empted state-law positive enactments that added to the federally prescribed warning.  79 Stat. 283.  Congress amended the Labeling Act a few years later by enacting the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.[Footnote 4]  The amendments strengthened the language of the prescribed warning, 84 Stat. 88, and prohibited cigarette advertising in \u201cany medium of electronic communication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction,\u201d id., at 89.  They also broadened the Labeling Act\u2019s pre-emption provision.  See Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion) (discussing the difference in scope of the pre-emption clauses of the 1965 and 1969 Acts).  The Labeling Act has since been amended further to require cigarette manufacturers to include four more explicit warnings in their packaging and advertisements on a rotating basis.[Footnote 5]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stated purpose of the Labeling Act is\n\u201cto establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health, whereby\u2014 \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(1) the public may be adequately informed that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health by inclusion of a warning to that effect on each package of cigarettes; and\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c(2) commerce and the national economy may be (A) protected to the maximum extent consistent with this declared policy and (B) not impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\u201d  79 Stat. 282, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.\n\nThe requirement that cigarette manufacturers include in their packaging and advertising the precise warnings mandated by Congress furthers the Act\u2019s first purpose.  And the Act\u2019s pre-emption provisions promote its second purpose.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As amended, the Labeling Act contains two express pre-emption provisions.  Section 5(a) protects cigarette manufacturers from inconsistent state labeling laws by prohibiting the requirement of additional statements relating to smoking and health on cigarette packages.  15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71334(a).  Section 5(b), which is at issue in this case, provides that \u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\u201d  \u00a71334(b).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Together, the labeling requirement and pre-emption provisions express Congress\u2019 determination that the prescribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient to achieve its purpose of informing the public of the health consequences of smoking.  Because Congress has decided that no additional warning statement is needed to attain that goal, States may not impede commerce in cigarettes by enforcing rules that are based on an assumption that the federal warnings are inadequate.  Although both of the Act\u2019s purposes are furthered by prohibiting States from supplementing the federally prescribed warning, neither would be served by limiting the States\u2019 authority to prohibit deceptive statements in cigarette advertising.  Petitioners acknowledge that \u201cCongress had no intention of insulating tobacco companies from liability for inaccurate statements about the relationship between smoking and health.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 28.  But they maintain that Congress could not have intended to permit the enforcement of state fraud rules because doing so would defeat the Labeling Act\u2019s purpose of preventing nonuniform state warning requirements.  15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.[Footnote 6]  As we observed in Cipollone, however, fraud claims \u201crely only on a single, uniform standard: falsity.\u201d  505 U. S., at 529 (plurality opinion).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it is clear that fidelity to the Act\u2019s purposes does not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question that we must decide is whether the text of \u00a71334(b) nevertheless requires that result.\nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have construed the operative phrases of \u00a71334(b) in two prior cases: Cipollone, 505 U. S. 504, and Reilly, 533 U. S. 525.  On both occasions we recognized that the phrase \u201cbased on smoking and health\u201d modifies the state-law rule at issue rather than a particular application of that rule.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Cipollone, the plurality, which consisted of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, O\u2019Connor, and Stevens, read the pre-emption provision in the 1969 amendments to the Labeling Act to pre-empt common-law rules as well as positive enactments.  Unlike Justices Blackmun, Kennedy, and Souter, the plurality concluded that the provision does not preclude all common-law claims that have some relationship to smoking and health.  505 U. S., at 521\u2013523.  To determine whether a particular common-law claim is pre-empted, the plurality inquired \u201cwhether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages action constitutes a \u2018requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health \u2026 with respect to \u2026 advertising or promotion,\u2019 giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.\u201d  Id., at 524.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying this standard, the plurality held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepresented and concealed a material fact was not pre-empted.  That claim alleged a violation of the manufacturers\u2019 duty not to deceive\u2014a duty that is not \u201cbased on\u201d smoking and health.  Id., at 528\u2013529.  Respondents in this case also allege a violation of the duty not to deceive as that duty is codified in the MUTPA.  The duty codified in that state statute, like the duty imposed by the state common-law rule at issue in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smoking and health.[Footnote 7]  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners endeavor to distance themselves from that holding by arguing that respondents\u2019 claim is more analogous to the \u201cwarning neutralization\u201d claim found to be pre-empted in Cipollone.  Although the plurality understood the plaintiff to have presented that claim as a \u201ctheory of fraudulent misrepresentation,\u201d id., at 528, the gravamen of the claim was the defendants\u2019 failure to warn, as it was \u201cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements in advertising and promotional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking,\u201d id., at 527.  Thus understood, the Cipollone plurality\u2019s analysis of the warning neutralization claim has no application in this case.[Footnote 8] \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners nonetheless contend that respondents\u2019 claim is like the pre-empted warning neutralization claim because it is based on statements that \u201cmight create a false impression\u201d rather than statements that are \u201cinherently false.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 39.  But the extent of the falsehood alleged does not alter the nature of the claim.  Nothing in the Labeling Act\u2019s text or purpose or in the plurality opinion in Cipollone suggests that whether a claim is pre-empted turns in any way on the distinction between misleading and inherently false statements.  Petitioners\u2019 misunderstanding is the same one that led the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, when confronted with a \u201clight\u201d descriptors claim, to reach a result at odds with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in this case.  See Brown, 479 F.\u00a03d, at 391\u2013393.  Certainly, the extent of the falsehood alleged may bear on whether a plaintiff can prove her fraud claim, but the merits of respondents\u2019 claim are not before us.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once that erroneous distinction is set aside, it is clear that our holding in Cipollone that the common-law fraud claim was not pre-empted is directly applicable to the statutory claim at issue in this case.  As was true of the claim in Cipollone, respondents\u2019 claim that the deceptive statements \u201clight\u201d and \u201clowered tar and nicotine\u201d induced them to purchase petitioners\u2019 product alleges a breach of the duty not to deceive.[Footnote 9]  To be sure, the presence of the federally mandated warnings may bear on the materiality of petitioners\u2019 allegedly fraudulent statements, \u201cbut that possibility does not change [respondents\u2019] case from one about the statements into one about the warnings.\u201d  501 F.\u00a03d, at 44.[Footnote 10]  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Reilly is consistent with Cipollone\u2019s analysis.  Reilly involved regulations promulgated by the Massachusetts attorney general \u201c\u00a0\u2018in order to address the incidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use by children under legal age \u2026 [and] in order to prevent access to such products by underage customers.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  533 U. S., at 533 (quoting 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a721.01 (2000)).  The regulations did not pertain to the content of any advertising; rather, they placed a variety of restrictions on certain cigarette sales and the location of outdoor and point-of-sale cigarette advertising.  The attorney general promulgated those restrictions pursuant to his statutory authority to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices.  Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93A, \u00a72 (West 1996).  But although the attorney general\u2019s authority derived from a general deceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this case, the challenged regulations targeted advertising that tended to promote tobacco use by children instead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.  Thus, whereas the \u201cprohibition\u201d in Cipollone was the common-law fraud rule, the \u201cprohibitions\u201d in Reilly were the targeted regulations.  Accordingly, our holding in Reilly that the regulations were pre-empted provides no support for an argument that a general prohibition of deceptive practices is \u201cbased on\u201d the harm caused by the specific kind of deception to which the prohibition is applied in a given case.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true, as petitioners argue, that the appeal of their advertising is based on the relationship between smoking and health.  And although respondents have expressly repudiated any claim for damages for personal injuries, see App. 26a, their actual injuries likely encompass harms to health as well as the monetary injuries they allege.  These arguments are unavailing, however, because the text of \u00a71334(b) does not refer to harms related to smoking and health.  Rather, it pre-empts only requirements and prohibitions\u2014i.e., rules\u2014that are based on smoking and health.  The MUTPA says nothing about either \u201csmoking\u201d or \u201chealth.\u201d  It is a general rule that creates a duty not to deceive and is therefore unlike the regulations at issue in Reilly.[Footnote 11]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners argue in the alternative that we should reject the express pre-emption framework established by the Cipollone plurality and relied on by the Court in Reilly.  In so doing, they invoke the reasons set forth in the separate opinions of Justice Blackmun (who especially criticized the plurality\u2019s holding that the failure-to-warn claim was pre-empted) and Justice Scalia (who argued that the fraud claim also should be pre-empted).  While we again acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack \u201ctheoretical elegance,\u201d we remain persuaded that it represents \u201ca fair understanding of congressional purpose.\u201d  Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 529\u2013530, n. 27 (plurality opinion).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners also contend that the plurality opinion is inconsistent with our decisions in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995), and Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008).  Both cases, however, are inapposite\u2014the first because it involved a pre-emption provision much broader than the Labeling Act\u2019s, and the second because it involved precisely the type of state rule that Congress had intended to pre-empt.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue in Wolens was the pre-emptive effect of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49\u00a0U. S.\u00a0C. App.\u00a0\u00a71305(a)(1) (1988 ed.), which prohibits States from enacting or enforcing any law \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services of any air carrier.\u201d  The plaintiffs in that case sought to bring a claim under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 815, \u00a7505 (West 1992).  Our conclusion that the state-law claim was pre-empted turned on the unusual breadth of the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision.  We had previously held that the meaning of the key phrase in the ADA\u2019s pre-emption provision, \u201c\u00a0\u2018relating to rates, routes, or services,\u2019\u00a0\u201d is a broad one.  Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383\u2013384 (1992) (emphasis added).  Relying on precedents construing the pre-emptive effect of the same phrase in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71144(a), we concluded that the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d indicates Congress\u2019 intent to pre-empt a large area of state law to further its purpose of deregulating the airline industry.  504 U. S., at 383\u2013384.[Footnote 12]  Unquestionably, the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d has a broader scope than the Labeling Act\u2019s reference to rules \u201cbased on\u201d smoking and health; whereas \u201crelating to\u201d is synonymous with \u201chaving a connection with,\u201d id., at 384, \u201cbased on\u201d describes a more direct relationship, see Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 13) (\u201cIn common talk, the phrase \u2018based on\u2019 indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners\u2019 reliance on Riegel is similarly misplaced.  The plaintiffs in Riegel sought to bring common-law design, manufacturing, and labeling defect claims against the manufacturer of a faulty catheter.  The case presented the question whether those claims were expressly pre-empted by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA), 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360c et seq.  The MDA\u2019s pre-emption clause provides that no State \u201c\u00a0\u2018may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device \u2026 any requirement\u2019 relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements.\u201d  Riegel, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7360k(a); emphasis deleted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The catheter at issue in Riegel had received premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  We concluded that premarket approval imposes \u201crequirement[s] relating to safety [and] effectiveness\u201d because the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no design, manufacturing, or labeling deviations from the specifications in its approved application.  The plaintiffs\u2019 products liability claims fell within the core of the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision because they sought to impose different requirements on precisely those aspects of the device that the FDA had approved.  Unlike the Cipollone plaintiff\u2019s fraud claim, which fell outside of the Labeling Act\u2019s pre-emptive reach because it did not seek to impose a prohibition \u201cbased on smoking and health,\u201d the Riegel plaintiffs\u2019 common-law products liability claims unquestionably sought to enforce \u201crequirement[s] relating to safety or effectiveness\u201d under the MDA.  That the \u201crelating to\u201d language of the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision is, like the ADA\u2019s, much broader than the operative language of the Labeling Act provides an additional basis for distinguishing Riegel.  Thus, contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, Riegel is entirely consistent with our holding in Cipollone. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, we conclude now, as the plurality did in Cipollone, that \u201cthe phrase \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements.\u201d  505 U. S., at 529.\nIV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an alternative to their express pre-emption argument, petitioners contend that respondents\u2019 claim is impliedly pre-empted because, if allowed to proceed, it would present an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC.  According to petitioners, the FTC has for decades promoted the development and consumption of low tar cigarettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on representations of tar and nicotine content based on Cambridge Filter Method testing in choosing among cigarette brands.  Even if such a regulatory policy could provide a basis for obstacle pre-emption, petitioners\u2019 description of the FTC\u2019s actions in this regard are inaccurate.  The Government itself disavows any policy authorizing the use of \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d descriptors.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201333.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1966, following the publication of the Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking and health, the FTC issued an industry guidance stating its view that \u201ca factual statement of the tar and nicotine content (expressed in milligrams) of the mainstream smoke from a cigarette,\u201d as measured by Cambridge Filter Method testing, would not violate the FTC Act.  App. 478a.  The Commission made clear, however, that the guidance applied only to factual assertions of tar and nicotine yields and did not invite \u201ccollateral representations \u2026 made, expressly or by implication, as to reduction or elimination of health hazards.\u201d  Id., at 479a.  A year later, the FTC reiterated its position in a letter to the National Association of Broadcasters.  The letter explained that, as a \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d the Commission would not challenge statements of tar and nicotine content when \u201cthey are shown to be accurate and fully substantiated by tests conducted in accordance with the [Cambridge Filter Method].\u201d  Id., at 368a.  In 1970, the FTC considered providing further guidance, proposing a rule that would have required manufacturers to disclose tar and nicotine yields as measured by Cambridge Filter Method testing.  35 Fed. Reg. 12671.  The leading cigarette manufacturers responded by submitting a voluntary agreement under which they would disclose tar and nicotine content in their advertising, App. 899a\u2013900a, and the FTC suspended its rulemaking, 36 Fed. Reg. 784 (1971).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on these events, petitioners assert that \u201cthe FTC has required tobacco companies to disclose tar and nicotine yields in cigarette advertising using a government-mandated testing methodology and has authorized them to use descriptors as shorthand references to those numerical test results.\u201d  Brief for Petitioners 2 (emphasis in original).  As the foregoing history shows, however, the FTC has in fact never required that cigarette manufacturers disclose tar and nicotine yields, nor has it condoned representations of those yields through the use of \u201clight\u201d or \u201clow tar\u201d descriptors.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent Commission actions further undermine petitioners\u2019 claim.  After the tobacco companies agreed to report tar and nicotine yields as measured by the Cambridge Filter Method, the FTC continued to police cigarette companies\u2019 misleading use of test results.  In 1983, the FTC responded to findings that tar and nicotine yields for Barclay cigarettes obtained through Cambridge Filter Method testing were deceptive because the cigarettes in fact delivered disproportionately more tar to smokers than other cigarettes with similar Cambridge Filter Method ratings.  48 Fed. Reg. 15954.  And in 1995, the FTC found that a manufacturer\u2019s representation \u201cthat consumers will get less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand cigarettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands\u201d was deceptive even though it was based on the results of Cambridge Filter Method testing.  In\u00a0re American Tobacco Co., 119 F.\u00a0T. C. 3, 4.  The FTC\u2019s conclusion was based on its recognition that, \u201c[i]n truth and in fact, consumers will not necessarily get less tar\u201d due to \u201csuch behavior as compensatory smoking.\u201d  Ibid.[Footnote 13]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This history shows that, contrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion, the FTC has no longstanding policy authorizing collateral representations based on Cambridge Filter Method test results.  Rather, the FTC has endeavored to inform consumers of the comparative tar and nicotine content of different cigarette brands and has in some instances prevented misleading representations of Cambridge Filter Method test results.  The FTC\u2019s failure to require petitioners to correct their allegedly misleading use of \u201clight\u201d descriptors is not evidence to the contrary; agency nonenforcement of a federal statute is not the same as a policy of approval.  Cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 (2002) (holding that the Coast Guard\u2019s decision not to regulate propeller guards did not impliedly pre-empt petitioner\u2019s tort claims).[Footnote 14]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More telling are the FTC\u2019s recent statements regarding the use of \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d descriptors.  In 1997, the Commission observed that \u201c[t]here are no official definitions for\u201d the terms \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar,\u201d and it sought comments on whether \u201cthere [is] a need for official guidance with respect to the terms\u201d and whether \u201cthe descriptors convey implied health claims.\u201d  62 Fed. Reg. 48163.  In November 2008, following public notice and comment, the Commission rescinded its 1966 guidance concerning the Cambridge Filter Method.  73 Fed. Reg. 74500.  The rescission is a response to \u201ca consensus among the public health and scientific communities that the Cambridge Filter method is sufficiently flawed that statements of tar and nicotine yields as measured by that method are not likely to help consumers make informed decisions.\u201d Id., at 74503.  The Commission\u2019s notice of its proposal to rescind the guidance also reiterated the original limits of that guidance, noting that it \u201conly addresse[d] simple factual statements of tar and nicotine yields.  It d[id] not apply to other conduct or express or implied representations, even if they concern[ed] tar and nicotine yields.\u201d  Id., at 40351.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, neither the handful of industry guidances and consent orders on which petitioners rely nor the FTC\u2019s inaction with regard to \u201clight\u201d descriptors even arguably justifies the pre-emption of state deceptive practices rules like the MUTPA.\nV\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude, as we did in Cipollone, that the Labeling Act does not pre-empt state-law claims like respondents\u2019 that are predicated on the duty not to deceive.  We also hold that the FTC\u2019s various decisions with respect to statements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly pre-empt respondents\u2019 claim.  Respondents still must prove that petitioners\u2019 use of \u201clight\u201d and \u201clowered tar\u201d descriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices statute, but neither the Labeling Act\u2019s pre-emption provision nor the FTC\u2019s actions in this field prevent a jury from considering that claim.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0The MUTPA provides, as relevant, that \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are declared unlawful.\u201d  \u00a7207.  In construing that section, courts are to \u201cbe guided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to Section 45(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 United States Code 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.\u201d  \u00a7207(1).\n\u00a0The Cambridge Filter Method weighs and measures the tar and nicotine collected by a smoking machine that takes 35 milliliter puffs of two seconds\u2019 duration every 60 seconds until the cigarette is smoked to a specified butt length.  App. 294a, 668a.  As discussed below, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) signaled in 1966 that the Cambridge Filter Method was an acceptable means of measuring the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes, but it never required manufacturers to publish test results in their advertisements.\n\u00a079 Stat. 282.\n\u00a0Pub. L. 91\u2013222, 84 Stat. 87.  Though actually enacted in 1970, Congress directed that it be cited as a \u201c1969 Act.\u201d\n\u00a0Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. 98\u2013474, \u00a74(a), 98 Stat. 2201, 15 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71333(a).\n\u00a0Petitioners also urge us to find support for their claim that Congress gave the FTC exclusive authority to police deceptive health-related claims in cigarette advertising in what they refer to as the Labeling Act\u2019s \u201csaving clause.\u201d  The clause provides that, apart from the warning requirement, nothing in the Act \u201cshall be construed to limit, restrict, expand, or otherwise affect the authority of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertising of cigarettes.\u201d  \u00a71336.  A plurality of this Court has previously read this clause to \u201cindicat[e] that Congress intended the phrase \u2018relating to smoking and health\u2019 \u2026 to be construed narrowly, so as not to proscribe the regulation of deceptive advertising.\u201d  Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 528\u2013529 (1992).  Nothing in the clause suggests that Congress meant to proscribe the States\u2019 historic regulation of deceptive advertising practices.  The FTC has long depended on cooperative state regulation to achieve its mission because, although one of the smallest administrative agencies, it is charged with policing an enormous amount of activity.  See 1 S. Kanwit, Federal Trade Commission \u00a7\u00a71:1, 1:2 (2004 ed. and Supp. 2008).  Moreover, when the Labeling Act was amended in 1969 it was not even clear that the FTC possessed rulemaking authority, see 84 Stat. 89, making it highly unlikely that Congress would have intended to assign exclusively to the FTC the substantial task of overseeing deceptive practices in cigarette advertisements.\n\u00a0In his dissent, Justice Thomas criticizes our reliance on the plurality opinion in Cipollone, post, at 6\u20138, 14\u201319, 22, and advocates adopting the analysis set forth by Justice Scalia in his opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part in that case, post, at 3\u20136, 19\u201321.  But Justice Scalia\u2019s approach was rejected by seven Members of the Court, and in the almost 17 years since Cipollone was decided Congress has done nothing to indicate its approval of that approach.  Moreover, Justice Thomas fails to explain why Congress would have intended the result that Justice Scalia\u2019s approach would produce\u2014namely, permitting cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent advertising.  As a majority of the Court concluded in Cipollone, nothing in the Labeling Act\u2019s language or purpose supports that result.\n\u00a0The Cipollone plurality further stated that the warning neutralization claim was \u201cmerely the converse of a state-law requirement that warnings be included in advertising and promotional materials,\u201d 505 U. S., at 527, evincing the plurality\u2019s recognition that warning neutralization and failure-to-warn claims are two sides of the same coin.  Justice Thomas\u2019 criticism of the plurality\u2019s treatment of the failure-to-warn claim, post, at 16, is beside the point, as no such claim is at issue in this litigation.\n\u00a0As the Court of Appeals observed, respondents\u2019 allegations regarding petitioners\u2019 use of the statements \u201clight\u201d and \u201clowered tar and nicotine\u201d could also support a warning neutralization claim.  But respondents did not bring such a claim, and the fact that they could have does not, as petitioners suggest, elevate form over substance.  There is nothing new in the recognition that the same conduct might violate multiple proscriptions.  \n\u00a0Justice Thomas contends that respondents\u2019 fraud claim must be pre-empted because \u201c[a] judgment in [their] favor will \u2026 result in a \u2018requirement\u2019 that petitioners represent the effects of smoking on health in a particular way in their advertising and promotion of light cigarettes.\u201d  Post, at 3.  He further asserts that \u201crespondents seek to require the cigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings about compensatory behavior, or to prohibit them from selling these products with the \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018low-tar\u2019 descriptors.\u201d  Post, at 20.  But this mischaracterizes the relief respondents seek.  If respondents prevail at trial, petitioners will be prohibited from selling as \u201clight\u201d or \u201clow tar\u201d only those cigarettes that are not actually light and do not actually deliver less tar and nicotine.  Barring intervening federal regulation, petitioners would remain free to make nonfraudulent use of the \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow-tar\u201d descriptors.  \n\u00a0In implementing the MUTPA, neither the state legislature nor the state attorney general has enacted a set of special rules or guidelines targeted at cigarette advertising.  As we noted in Cipollone, it was the threatened enactment of new state warning requirements rather than the enforcement of pre-existing general prohibitions against deceptive practices that prompted congressional action in 1969.  505 U. S., at 515, and n.\u00a011.\n\u00a0Petitioners also point to Morales as evidence that our decision in Cipollone was wrong.  But Morales predated Cipollone, and it is in any event even more easily distinguishable from this case than American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S.219 (1995).  At issue in Morales were guidelines regarding the form and substance of airline fare advertising implemented by the National Association of Attorneys General to give content to state deceptive practices rules.  504 U. S., at 379.  Like the regulations at issue in Reilly, the guidelines were industry-specific directives that targeted the subject matter made off-limits by the ADA\u2019s express pre-emption provisions.  See also Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (holding that targeted ground carrier regulations were pre-empted by a statute modeled on the ADA). \n\u00a0In a different action, the FTC charged a cigarette manufacturer with violating the FTC Act by misleadingly advertising certain brands as \u201clow in tar\u201d even though they had a higher-than-average tar rating.  See In\u00a0re American Brands, Inc., 79 F.\u00a0T.\u00a0C. 255 (1971).  The Commission and the manufacturer entered a consent order that prevented the manufacturer from making any such representations unless they were accompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the cigarettes\u2019 tar and nicotine content as measured by the Cambridge Filter Method.  Id., at 258.  Petitioners offer this consent order as evidence that the FTC authorized the use of \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d descriptors as long as they accurately describe Cambridge Filter Method test results.  As the Government observes, however, the decree only enjoined conduct.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.  And a consent order is in any event only binding on the parties to the agreement.  For all of these reasons, the consent order does not support the conclusion that respondents\u2019 claim is impliedly pre-empted.\n\u00a0It seems particularly inappropriate to read a policy of authorization into the FTC\u2019s inaction when that inaction is in part the result of petitioners\u2019 failure to disclose study results showing that Cambridge Filter Method test results do not reflect the amount of tar and nicotine that consumers of \u201clight\u201d cigarettes actually inhale.

UNITED STATES\ncertiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit\nNo. 08\u2013192.\u2003Argued March 4, 2009\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nA wiretap of Mohammed Said\u2019s telephone recorded six calls in which petitioner Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two separate 1-gram transactions.  Those two purchases were misdemeanors under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844, while Said\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b).  The Government charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the phone calls, some placed by him, some by Said, violated \u00a7843(b), which makes it a felony \u201cto use any communication facility in \u2026 facilitating\u201d felony distribution and other drug crimes.  The District Court denied Abuelhawa\u2019s acquittal motion, in which he argued that his efforts to make misdemeanor purchases could not be treated as facilitating Said\u2019s felonies.  The jury convicted Abuelhawa on all six felony counts.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d should be given its ordinary meaning in \u00a7843(b) and that Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation because it made Said\u2019s distribution of the drug easier.  \nHeld:\u00a0Using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d felony drug distribution in violation of \u00a7843(b).  Stopping with the plain meaning of \u201cfacilitate\u201d here would ignore the rule that because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, \u201c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.\u201d  Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486.  Here it does not.  The literal sweep of \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d sits uncomfortably with common usage:\u00a0Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the other\u2019s conduct.  The common usage has its parallel in cases holding that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the legislature\u2019s punishment calibration.  In Gebardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112, 119, for example, the Court held that a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to have sex could not be tagged with the Mann Act violation for \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing]\u201d interstate transportation for immoral purposes because the statutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation.\u201d  Such cases have a bearing here in two ways.  First, given the presumption, see, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 380\u2013381, and n.\u00a012, that the Congress that enacted \u00a7843(b) was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist,\u201d it is likely the Legislature had a comparable scope in mind when it used \u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with equivalent meaning.  Second, any broader reading would for practical purposes substantially skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties.  Moreover, the statute\u2019s history\u2014which shows that in 1970 the CSA downgraded simple possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, \u00a7844(a), and simultaneously limited the communications provision\u2019s prohibition of facilitating a drug \u201coffense\u201d to facilitating a \u201cfelony,\u201d \u00a7843(b)\u2014drives home what is clear from the statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than felony distribution, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a felony.  Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simultaneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the same offense, simple drug possession, it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the right.  Given that Congress used no language spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background usage of terms such as \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d that points in the opposite direction and accords with the CSA\u2019s choice to classify small purchases as misdemeanors, the Government\u2019s position is just too unlikely.

S.\u00a0C. \u00a7843(b).  The question here is whether someone violates \u00a7843(b) in making a misdemeanor drug purchase because his phone call to the dealer can be said to facilitate the felony of drug distribution.  The answer is no.\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FBI agents believed Mohammed Said was selling cocaine and got a warrant to tap his cell phone.  In the course of listening in, they recorded six calls between Said and petitioner Salman Khade Abuelhawa, during which Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two separate transactions, each time a single gram.  Abuelhawa\u2019s two purchases were misdemeanors, \u00a7844, while Said\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b).  The Government nonetheless charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the phone calls, whether placed by Abuelhawa or by Said, had been made \u201cin causing or facilitating\u201d Said\u2019s felonies, in violation of \u00a7843(b).[Footnote 1]  Abuelhawa moved for acquittal as a matter of law, arguing that his efforts to commit the misdemeanors of buying cocaine could not be treated as causing or facilitating Said\u2019s felonies, but the District Court denied his motion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\u201325a, and the jury convicted him on all six felony counts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abuelhawa argued the same point to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with as much success.  The Circuit reasoned that \u201cfor purposes of \u00a7843(b), \u2018facilitate\u2019 should be given its \u2018common meaning\u2014to make easier or less difficult, or to assist or aid.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  523 F.\u00a03d 415, 420 (2008) (quoting United States v. Lozano, 839 F.\u00a02d 1020, 1023 (CA4 1988)).  The court said Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation because it \u201cundoubtedly made Said\u2019s cocaine distribution easier; in fact, \u2018it made the sale possible.\u2019\u00a0\u201d  523 F.\u00a03d, at 421 (quoting United States v. Binkley, 903 F.\u00a02d 1130, 1136 (CA7 1990) (emphasis deleted)). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on the scope of \u00a7843(b),[Footnote 2] and we now reverse.\nII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government\u2019s argument is a reprise of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion, that Abuelhawa\u2019s use of his cell phone satisfies the plain meaning of \u201cfacilitate\u201d because it \u201callow[ed] the transaction to take place more efficiently, and with less risk of detection, than if the purchaser and seller had to meet in person.\u201d  Brief for United States 10.  And of course on the literal plane, the phone calls could be described as \u201cfacilitating\u201d drug distribution; they \u201cundoubtedly made . . . distribution easier.\u201d  523 F.\u00a03d, at 421.  But stopping there would ignore the rule that, because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, see United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993), \u201c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006).  We think the word here does not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, the Government\u2019s literal sweep of \u201cfacilitate\u201d sits uncomfortably with common usage.  Where a transaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the conduct of the other.  A buyer does not just make a sale easier; he makes the sale possible.  No buyer, no sale; the buyer\u2019s part is already implied by the term \u201csale,\u201d and the word \u201cfacilitate\u201d adds nothing.  We would not say that the borrower facilitates the bank loan. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government, however, replies that using the instrument of communication under \u00a7843(b) is different from borrowing the money or merely handing over the sale price for cocaine.  Drugs can be sold without anyone\u2019s mailing a letter or using a cell phone.  Because cell phones, say, really do make it easier for dealers to break the law, Congress probably meant to ratchet up the culpability of the buyer who calls ahead.  But we think that argument comes up short against several more reasons that count against the Government\u2019s position.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common usage that limits \u201cfacilitate\u201d to the efforts of someone other than a primary or necessary actor in the commission of a substantive crime has its parallel in the decided cases.  The traditional law is that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the calibration of punishment set by the legislature, a line of reasoning exemplified in the courts\u2019 consistent refusal to treat noncriminal liquor purchases as falling under the prohibition against aiding or abetting the illegal sale of alcohol.  See Lott v. United States, 205 F. 28, 29\u201331 (CA9 1913) (collecting cases).  And this Court followed the same course in rejecting the broadest possible reading of a similar provision in Gebardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112 (1932).  The question there was whether a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to engage in \u201cillicit sexual relations\u201d could be tagged with \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing] in \u2026 transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or of debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\u201d in violation of the Mann Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825.  Gebardi, 287 U. S., at 116\u2013118 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Since the statutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the subject of the transportation,\u201d we refused to \u201cinfer that the mere acquiescence of the woman transported was intended to be condemned by the general language punishing those who aid and assist the transporter, any more than it has been inferred that the purchaser of liquor was to be regarded as an abettor of the illegal sale.\u201d  Id., at 119 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These cases do not strictly control the outcome of this one, but we think they have a bearing here, in two ways.  As we have said many times, we presume legislatures act with case law in mind, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 380\u2013381, and n.\u00a012 (2000), and we presume here that when Congress enacted \u00a7843(b), it was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist.\u201d  We thus think it likely that Congress had comparable scope in mind when it used the term \u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with equivalent meaning, compare Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 76 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201caid and abet\u201d as to \u201cfacilitate the commission of a crime\u201d) with id., at 627 (defining \u201cfacilitation\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or an instance of aiding or helping; . . . the act of making it easier for another person to commit a crime\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And applying the presumption is supported significantly by the fact that here, as in the earlier cases, any broader reading of \u201cfacilitate\u201d would for practical purposes skew the congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller penalties.  When the statute was enacted, the use of land lines in drug transactions was common, and in these days when everyone over the age of three seems to carry a cell phone, the Government\u2019s interpretation would skew the calibration of penalties very substantially.  The respect owed to that penalty calibration cannot be minimized.  Prior to 1970, Congress punished the receipt, concealment, purchase, or sale of any narcotic drug as a felony, see 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7174 (1964 ed.) (repealed), and on top of that added a minimum of two years, and up to five, for using a communication facility in committing, causing, or facilitating, any drug \u201coffense,\u201d 18 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a71403 (1964 ed.).  In 1970, however, the CSA, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7801 et seq., downgraded simple possession of a controlled substance to a misdemeanor, 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7844(a) (2006 ed.), and simultaneously limited the communications provision to prohibiting only the facilitation of a drug \u201cfelony,\u201d \u00a7843(b).  This history drives home what is already clear in the current statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than the felony of distributing drugs, and to narrow the scope of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a drug felony.  Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simultaneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the same offense it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the right.  As the Government sees it, Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a phone in making two small drug purchases would subject him, in fact, to six felony counts and a potential sentence of 24 years in prison, even though buying the same drugs minus the phone would have supported only two misdemeanor counts and two years of prison.  Given the CSA\u2019s distinction between simple possession and distribution, and the background history of these offenses, it is impossible to believe that Congress intended \u201cfacilitating\u201d to cause that twelve-fold quantum leap in punishment for simple drug possessors.[Footnote 3] \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government suggests that this background usage and the 1970 choice to reduce culpability for possession is beside the point because Congress sometimes incorporates aggravating factors into the Criminal Code, and the phone use here is just one of them; the Government mentions possession by a prior drug offender, a felony punishable by up to two years\u2019 imprisonment.  And, for perspective, the Government points to unauthorized possession of flunitrazepim, a drug used to incapacitate rape victims, which is punishable by imprisonment up to three years.  Brief for United States 20.  It would not be strange, the Government says, for Congress to \u201cdecid[e] to treat the use of a communication facility in a drug transaction as a significant act warranting additional punishment\u201d because \u201c[t]oday\u2019s communication facilities . . . make illicit drug transactions easier and more efficient . . . . [and] greatly reduce the risk that the participants will be detected while negotiating a transaction.\u201d  Id., at 23\u201324.  \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are skeptical.  There is no question that Congress intended \u00a7843(b) to impede illicit drug transactions by penalizing the use of communication devices in coordinating illegal drug operations, and no doubt that its purpose will be served regardless of the outcome in this case.  But it does not follow that Congress also meant a first-time buyer\u2019s phone calls to get two small quantities of drugs for personal use to expose him to punishment 12 times more severe than a purchase by a recidivist offender and 8 times more severe than the unauthorized possession of a drug used by rapists.[Footnote 4]  To the contrary, Congress used no language spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background usage of terms such as \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d that points in the opposite direction and accords with the CSA\u2019s choice to classify small purchases as misdemeanors.  The Government\u2019s position is just too unlikely.[Footnote 5] \nIII\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. \n\u00a0In full, \u00a7843(b) provides: \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to use any communication facility in committing or in causing or facilitating the commission of any act or acts constituting a felony under any provision of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.  Each separate use of a communication facility shall be a separate offense under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018communication facility\u2019 means any and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication.\u201d\nSection 843(d) provides, subject to exceptions not at issue here, that \u201cany person who violates this section shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 4 years, a fine . . . , or both.\u201d\n\u00a0Compare, e.g., United States v. Binkley, 903 F.\u00a02d 1130, 1135\u20131136 (CA7 1990) (buyer\u2019s use of phone in purchasing drugs facilitates seller\u2019s drug distribution), with United States v. Baggett, 890 F.\u00a02d 1095, 1097\u20131098 (CA10 1989) (buyer\u2019s use of phone in purchasing drugs does not facilitate seller\u2019s drug distribution); United States v. Martin, 599 F.\u00a02d 880, 888\u2013889 (CA9 1979) (same), overruled on other grounds, United States v. De Bright, 730 F.\u00a02d 1255 (CA9 1984).\n\u00a0The Government\u2019s suggestion that a result like this is not anomalous because a prosecutor could exercise his discretion to seek a lower sentence, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, simply begs the question.  Of course, Congress legislates against a background assumption of prosecutorial discretion, but this tells us nothing about the boundaries of punishment within which Congress intended the discretion to be exercised; prosecutorial discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to criminal statutes.  And it ill behooves the Government to invoke discretionary power in this case, with the prosecutor seeking a sentencing potential of 24 years when the primary offense is the purchase of two ounces of cocaine.  For that matter, see id., at 41\u201343 (concession by Government that current Department of Justice guidelines require individual prosecutors who bring charges to charge the maximum crime supported by the facts in a case). \n\u00a0The Government does nothing for its own cause by noting that 21 U. S.\u00a0C. \u00a7856 makes it a felony to facilitate \u201cthe simple possession of drugs by others by making available for use . . . a place for the purpose of unlawfully using a controlled substance\u201d even though the crime facilitated may be a mere misdemeanor.  Brief for United States 21 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  This shows that Congress knew how to be clear in punishing the facilitation of a misdemeanor as a felony, and it only highlights Congress\u2019s decision to limit \u00a7843(b) to the facilitation of a \u201cfelony.\u201d  \n\u00a0The Government asks us to affirm the Fourth Circuit on an alternative ground: that Abuelhawa used a communication facility \u201cin causing\u201d Said\u2019s drug felony rather than \u201cin . . . facilitating\u201d the felony.  But the Government\u2019s argument on this point takes the same form as its argument about the term \u201cfacilitate,\u201d and the reasons that lead us to reject the one argument apply just as well to the other.

The organizations claim that Idaho's Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA) violates their First Amendment free speech rights by restricting their ability to participate in any activities the VCA defines as \"political.\" The State officials conceded the unconstitutionality of many of the VCA's provisions, however they argued for the validity of prohibiting payroll deductions for \"political activities.\" The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho held the payroll deduction provisions constitutional as applied to the state government but unconstitutional when applied to private and local government employees. The State officials appealed, contending that the provisions should be equally applicable to both groups.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling that the payroll deduction provisions could not be applied to private and local government employees because the State had provided no \"compelling justification\" to do so. Furthermore, the court stated that the officials had failed to show that the case should be reviewed under the more relaxed standard for a \"non-public\" forum.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Do provisions of Idaho's Voluntary Contributions Act prohibiting payroll deductions for \"political activities\" violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment when applied to local government employees?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit holding that Idaho's Voluntary Contributions Act did not violate the free speech rights of local government employees. With Chief Justice John G. Roberts writing for the majority and joined by Justice Antonin G. Scalia, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in part, the Court reasoned that Idaho's law did not restrict political speech, but merely declined to promote speech by prohibiting public employees from directly contributing to partisan activities from their government issued paycheck. Using a rational-basis review, it recognized that the state had a reasonable interest in avoiding the appearance of impropriety by banning the funding of partisan political activity from the state's payroll. Moreover, the Court held that this governmental interest applied equally to governments at the state and local level.</p>\n<p>Justice Ginsburg wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice Stephen G. Breyer also wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part. He argued that rather than reverse the court of appeals, the case should have been remanded. Additionally, he argued that rather than apply a rational-basis review as the Court did here, he would utilize an \"intermediate scrutiny inquiry\" where the statute would be considered in light of whether it imposed a burden upon speech that was disproportionate to other interests the government sought to achieve. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented arguing that the Idaho statue was clearly intended to make it more difficult for government employees to finance speech and therefore was unconstitutional. Justice Stephen G. Breyer also dissented arguing that this case was a poor vehicle for refining the analysis of the First Amendment and therefore should have been denied review.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 20073, "name": "Clay Riggs Smith", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/clay_riggs_smith", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Smith", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "clay_riggs_smith"}, "advocate_description": "Deputy Attorney General, Boise, Idaho, argued the cause for the petitioners", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19828"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 29833, "name": "Jeremiah A.

After unsuccessfully appealing his case through direct review and state habeas proceedings, Bell filed a writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Bell argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, suggesting that his lawyer failed to investigate and present evidence from five witnesses that may have reduced his death sentence to life in prison.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, in <em>Strickland</em>, has previously stated that a petitioner must show (1) deficient performance and (2) prejudice in order to succeed on a claim for ineffective assistance. Based on these principles, the district court dismissed Bell's claim and, on appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The Fourth Circuit found that the conclusions of the Virginia state courts were reasonable and that Bell had failed to show that he had suffered actual prejudice.

The Attorney General requested that the implicated banks turn over certain non-public information to aid the investigation. The Clearing House Association (CHA), a consortium of national banks including several involved in the investigation, filed a lawsuit in a New York federal district court to prevent the Attorney General from continuing his investigation. The CHA argued that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the federal agency charged with overseeing national banks, was appropriately responsible for regulating the banks' compliance with activities that fall under the National Bank Act (NBA) and therefore precluded state officials like the Attorney General from doing so. In response, the Attorney General argued that the Federal Housing Act (FHA) provided an exception to the OCC's sole stewardship of the NBA and therefore authorized his investigation. The district court granted the CHA's request for an injunction and stopped the Attorney General's investigation.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained the injunction against the Attorney General's investigation, but used the decision in a separate case, filed by the OCC and utilizing different arguments, to do so. Here, the court of appeals held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide the FHA claim. It reasoned that since the Attorney General had not yet filed any lawsuits against the banks under investigation, the issue of whether the FHA provided an exception to the enforcement of the NBA was not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Are state officials precluded from regulating and enforcing banking activities governed by the National Bank Act and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's regulations?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. The Supreme Court held that the OCC's interpretation of the NBA that precluded state officials from regulating and enforcing banking activities was not reasonable. With Justice Antonin G. Scalia writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court distinguished between a state's \"visitorial powers\" \u2013 its supervisory powers \u2013 and its enforcement powers. The Court stated that the NBA only prevented a state from exercising its visitorial powers over banks. Therefore, the Court reasoned that a state was not precluded from exercising its ordinary powers to enforce state laws.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in part and dissented in part. He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito. Justice Thomas argued that because the definition of \"visitorial powers\" was ambiguous, the courts should have deferred to the OCC's interpretation of the term in the NBA.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 18121, "name": "Barbara D.

The contract called for royalty payments to the Navajo Nation not to exceed 37.5 cents per ton of coal mined. However, the contract allowed for the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the royalty rate to a \"reasonable\" level after twenty years. At the end of twenty years, the Navajo Nation was being paid the equivalent of 2 percent of the proceeds from the mining operation. As stipulated by the contract, the Navajo Nation entered into discussions with Peabody Coal Company (formerly Sentry Royalty Company) to adjust the royalty rate. After discussions failed, the Navajo Nation asked the Secretary of the Interior to resolve the dispute. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs reached an initial decision to set the royalty rate at 20 percent. This decision was delayed on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior. Unbeknownst to the Navajo Nation, the Secretary had been meeting with executives of the Peabody Coal Company who requested the delay. Facing dire economic circumstances, the Navajo Nation agreed to a royalty rate of 12.5 percent which was approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>\n<p>In 1993, the Navajo Nation brought suit against the United States for violations of its statutory and fiduciary duties to the Nation. It sought damages of $600 million. This latest decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit represents the fifth chapter in the long running saga over the original dispute. Its decision comes in the wake of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims holding, on instructions from the Supreme Court, that the Navajo Nation did not provide sufficient evidence to seek damages from the United States.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals disagreed. It held that the Navajo Nation marshaled sufficient evidence to show that the United States \"controls the leasing of the [Navajo's] coal resources and that the government is responsible for the liabilities arising thereunder.\" It reasoned that the body of regulations and statutes that governed the Nation's resources were \"reasonably amenable\" to an interpretation that imposed liability on the part of the government for breach of its duties.</p>\n", "question": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Does the decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Navajo Nation I</em>, foreclose this most recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the decision was not foreclosed, did the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit properly hold that the United States was liable based on its interpretation of statutes that do not address royalty rates in tribal leases?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No and No. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Antonin G. Scalia, the Court held that its decision in <em>Navajo I</em> had not definitively terminated the Nation's claim. In <em>Navajo I</em> it reasoned that the Nation's only avenue to sue the United States was by finding \"specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.\" The Court reasoned that since only three statutes were analyzed, there might exist a relevant statute that could provide the Nation a basis for its lawsuit. However, the Supreme Court also held that none of the sources of law cited by the Nation provided such a basis and therefore its suit should be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Justice David H. Souter, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, wrote a separate concurring opinion. He admitted regretting that his dissenting opinion in <em>Navajo I</em> was not controlling authority, but recognized the Court must abide its precedent.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 22617, "name": "Edwin S.

Scott Yeager of conspiracy, wire fraud, and security fraud, but hung on 20 counts of insider trading and 99 counts of money laundering in relation to his involvement with Enron Broadband Services. The district court declared a mistrial on the counts the jury hung on. Thereafter, the United States again indicted Mr. Yeager on a portion of the mistried counts. On interlocutory appeal, Mr. Yeager argued that in acquitting him of securities fraud, the jury \"necessarily found that he did not have insider information\", and therefore collateral estopple prevents the government from retrying him for insider trading and money laundering.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that collateral estoppel does not bar retrial in Mr. Yeager's case. It recognized that Mr. Yeager had the burden of proving the jury necessarily found that he was not guilty of insider trading. He did not, as a jury that found him not guilty of insider trading and \"acting rationally\" would have acquitted him of insider trading and money laundering. The court reasoned that because it was unclear the jury's rationale for its decisions, Mr. Yeager's mistried counts did not prevent his retrial on those counts.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the Double Jeopardy Clause bar retrial when a jury acquits a defendant on some counts, but fails to reach a verdict on other counts whose essential elements must have been decided in the defendant's favor by a rational jury?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that apparent inconsistencies between a jury's verdict of acquittal on some counts and its failure to return a verdict on other counts does not affect an acquittal's preclusive force. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, and Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, and in part by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Court stated that in Mr. Yeager's case, \"if the possession of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges [against him], a jury that decided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any charges for which that [fact] is an essential element.\"</p>\n<p>Justice Antonin G. Scalia dissented and was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito. He disagreed with the majority holding, arguing that it was a departure from not only the original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the Court's own precedent. Justice Alito also wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. While acknowledging his disagreement with the majority holding, he argued that in light of the decision, the courts should rigorously apply the doctrine of issue preclusion. Based on this, an acquittal on one charge only precludes indictment for a second charge if a \"rational jury\" could not have acquitted on the precedent charge without finding in the defendant's favor on the factual element necessary to convict on the second charge. Justice Kennedy also wrote separately, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. While agreeing with much of the majority holding, he noted the validity of Justice Alito's concerns with the decision.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 41089, "name": "Samuel J.

He was subsequently denied post-conviction relief by the trial court and the California Court of Appeals. Mr. Mirzayance then petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief in a California federal district court. He maintained that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because at trial, his attorney advised him to abandon his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity (NGI). The federal district court denied Mr. Mirzayance's petition, but was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to determining whether \"there were tactical reasons for abandoning the defense.\"</p>\n<p>At the hearing, the Magistrate Judge found that Mr. Mirzayance's counsel had \"nothing to lose\" by going forward with the NGI plea and thus found his performance ineffective. The federal district court accepted this finding and granted Mr. Mirzayance's petition for habeas corpus relief. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Mr. Mirzayance's attorney's advice to withdraw his NGI plea was unreasonable because there was \"reasonable probability\" the jury would find Mr. Mirzayance insane. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Ninth Circuit's decision, and remanded the case for consideration in light of <em>Carey v. Musladin</em>. On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its decision stating that Mr. Mirzayance's attorney's failure to pursue the NGI defense constituted ineffective counsel because it \"secured no tactical advantage.\"</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) Did the Ninth Circuit exceed it authority by granting habeas corpus relief without considering whether state court adjudication of Mr. Mirzayance's claim was \"unreasonable\" under 28 U.S.C. Section 2254(d)?</p>\n<p>2) May a federal appellate court substitute factual findings of the district court without determining whether the district court's findings were \"clearly erroneous?\"</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes and not answered. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit, holding that the California Court of Appeals' decision to deny Mr. Mirzayance's petition for habeas corpus relief was not \"an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\" With Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the majority and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Samuel A. Alito, the Court concluded that the Ninth Circuit reached an erroneous result because it applied an improper standard of review when it found Mr. Mirzayance's counsel ineffective for abandoning the NGI plea because there was \"nothing to lose\" in pursuing it. Rather, the Court stated that in order to find counsel ineffective, the defendant must show both \"deficient performance\" and \"prejudice.\" The Court reasoned that Mr. Mirzayance's counsel was not deficient when he abandoned an NGI plea that had \"almost no chance of success.\" Therefore, the California Court of Appeals was not \"unreasonable\" in denying Mr. Mirzayance's petition for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 41767, "name": "Steven E.

After being found guilty of these charges, Haywood commenced actions in state court against two of the corrections officers responsible for reviewing the claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 (Section 1983), a federal statute protecting civil rights. He asserted that the guilty verdicts had been handed down without sufficient evidence, that the officers had tampered with the urinalysis test, and that they had conspired to fabricate the facts set forth in the misbehavior reports. The defendants moved to dismiss Haywood's claims, basing their argument on a New York law prohibiting civil claims such as Haywood's brought against corrections officers in their official capacities. Haywood responded by arguing that when Congress created Section 1983 it intended the statute to supersede any state laws contradicting it. Because Section 1983 allowed these claims, Haywood argued, the New York law prohibiting them violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court of New York (the state's lowest-level court) agreed with the defendants and dismissed Haywood's claim based on the New York law.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals of New York affirmed the Supreme Court's decision, finding that the Supremacy Clause permits states to deny enforcement of a federal right in a case where a state court lacks jurisdiction due to a neutral state rule regarding the courts' administration. Because Haywood's claim would be barred if brought under either Section 1983 or an applicable state law, the New York law barring the claim was valid and neutral and did not violate the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does a state law barring civil claims against corrections officers violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution when it prohibits an inmate from bringing a claim for a violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that New York's Correction Law Section 24, prohibiting civil claims brought against corrections officers in their official capacities, as applied in Mr. Haywood's case, violated the Supremacy Clause and thus was unconstitutional. With Justice John Paul Stevens writing for the majority and joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court noted that New York had passed Section 24 after determining most damages suits filed by prisoners against state corrections officers were frivolous. However, the Court reasoned that states may not relieve whole categories of federal claims from their courts merely to avoid congestion.</p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented and was joined in part by Chief Justice John G.

Before the trial, Mr. Rivera's attorney moved to dismiss a potential juror. The judge did not allow it deeming the motion discriminatory towards the juror. On appeal after his conviction, Mr. Rivera argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the pre-trial motion and thus his conviction should be reversed. The Illinois Supreme Court remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to specify how the motion was discriminatory. After the trial court found that gender discrimination was at issue, the Illinois Supreme Court continued its review.</p>\n<p>It held that Mr. Rivera was improperly denied his pre-trial motion to dismiss the juror. It reasoned that there was no evidence Mr. Rivera's attorney aimed to dismiss the juror because of her gender. However, it also found that this was harmless error. It explained that there was no evidence that indicated Mr. Rivera was tried before a biased jury because of the improperly dismissed motion. Thus, Mr. Rivera's conviction should stand.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does an error in dismissing a defendant's pre-trial motion to dismiss a juror require automatic reversal of conviction because it denies the defendant's right to an impartial jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. A unanimous Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause does not require the automatic reversal of a conviction because of the trial court's good-faith error in denying the defendant's preemptory challenge to a juror, provided that all the jurors are qualified and unbiased. In her opinion for the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reasoned that since there is no constitutional right to preemptory challenges, the mistaken denial of a preemptory challenge does not on its own violate the Constitution. Rather, states are free to decide as a matter of law whether the mistaken denial of a preemptory challenge is reversible error. In this case, the Court agreed that the Illinois Supreme Court acted within its powers in determining the mistaken denial of Mr. Rivera's preemptory challenge was mere harmless error.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 31510, "name": "James K.

He appealed arguing that the Board abused its discretion in denying his motion and should have used its sua sponte power to reopen his proceedings. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the Board did not abuse its discretion. It also found that it lacked jurisdiction to review Mr. Nken's claim that the Board failed to use its sua sponte power in order to reopen his case. Thereafter, the Supreme Court granted Mr. Nken's motion for a stay of his removal until further proceeding by the Court.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Is the decision of a court of appeals to stay an alien's removal pending consideration of the alien's petition for review governed by the standard set forth in section 242(g)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(f)(2), or instead is it governed by the traditional test?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>The Supreme Court held that the traditional factors govern a court of appeals' authority to stay an alien's removal pending judicial review. With Chief Justice John G. Roberts writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court elucidated the four factors that govern stays. First, there must be more than a mere possibility that relief will be granted. Second, irreparable injury must be more than a mere possibility. The third and fourth factors, which respectively determine whether the stay will injure the other party and where the public interest lies, merge when the Government is the opposing party, as in this case. Consequently, the Court vacated the order in Mr. Nken's case and remanded it to the Fourth Circuit for review in light of its decision.</p>\n<p>Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Scalia, wrote a separate concurring opinion. He emphasized that stays are an extraordinary remedy and should not be granted lightly. Justice Samuel A. Alito dissented and was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. He argued that the majority decision nullified statutory provisions adopted by Congress in 1996 that stated immigration removal orders were \"self-executing\" and \"not dependent upon judicial enforcement.\"</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 34561, "name": "Lindsay C.

Over Ice's objection, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences based on its own findings of fact. Ice appealed, raising the question whether the Oregon or U.S. Constitutions require a jury, rather than a judge, to make the factual findings upon which a court decides to prescribe consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p>The Oregon Court of Appeals held that the consecutive sentences were not in violation of the State's Constitution because none of the factual issues reviewed by the judge were an \"element\" of the crime. However, the sentences did violate the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the factual findings were not made by a jury but were used to increase Ice's punishment to more than what the jury had imposed.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Do consecutive sentences imposed upon a criminal defendant based on factual findings made by a judge, rather than jury, violate the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. In a 5-4 decision with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing for the majority and joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and Justice Samuel A. Alito, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not prevent states from assigning to judges rather than to juries fact finding responsibilities necessary to imposing consecutive sentences on criminal defendants. The Court drew its reasoning from the historical record. Since the nation's founding, judges have served in this capacity. Additionally, the Court reasoned that judges serving in this capacity do not infringe upon the traditional responsibilities of a jury in a criminal trial.</p>\n<p>Justice Antonin G. Scalia dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice David H. Souter, and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Scalia argued that in Mr. Ice's case, the Court's opinion in <em>Apprendi</em> should control. There, the Court was clear that any fact finding necessary to the enhancement of a criminal sentence must be done by the jury.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 36859, "name": "Mary H.

In exchange for his guilty plea, Mr. Denedo was offered a reduced sentence that included three months of confinement, a demotion, and a bad-conduct discharge. Eight years later, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services began proceedings to deport Mr. Denedo, a Nigerian immigrant and lawful permanent resident of the United States, based on his court-martial conviction. In light of these developments, Mr. Denedo filed a petition with the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals for extraordinary relief and requested review of his court-martial and a writ of error coram nobis in order to achieve his pre-conviction state. He argued that his counsel at the court-martial was ineffective because he had specifically stated during the proceeding that \"his primary concern and objective\" was \"to avoid the risk of deportation\" and was less concerned about the amount of time he spent in prison. At the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals, the government motioned to dismiss Mr. Denedo's petition on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The court disagreed and found it had jurisdiction as provided by 28 U.S.C. Section 1651 - the All Writs Act. It then denied Mr. Denedo's petition. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces agreed that the Court of Criminal Appeals had jurisdiction to review the petition, but remanded the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further fact finding in order to determine whether Mr. Denedo's counsel was deficient.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Does the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals retain jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Section 1651, the All Writs Act, to consider a writ of error <em>coram nobis</em> sought by a former service member?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Yes. The Supreme Court held that Article I courts, like the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA), retain jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to consider <em>coram nobis</em> petitions that allege a prior judgment of conviction was fundamentally flawed. With Anthony M. Kennedy writing for the majority and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer, the Court reasoned that since Mr. Denedo's <em>coram nobis</em> petition was simply a further step in his criminal appeal, the NMCCA retained jurisdiction to issue the writ, as the petition challenged the validity of the court's original ruling.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts dissented, oined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito. Roberts disagreed with the majority that Article I courts have jurisdiction to consider <em>coram nobis</em> petitions. Rather, he argued that military courts are severely restricted in their jurisdiction, which cannot extend beyond the precise limits granted them by Congress.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 38316, "name": "Pratik A.

He claimed that he was only involved in the robbery after the shooting had taken place. On appeal, Mr. Pulido argued that the jury instructions were in error and allowed a jury to convict him as an accomplice in the robbery and murder, even if he only took part in the robbery. The California Supreme Court refused to overturn the conviction holding that the error was harmless because the jury had specifically found that Mr. Pulido aided the robbery during the murder.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pulido sought and was granted habeas relief by a federal district court in California. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. It held that instructing a jury on multiple theories of guilt, one of which was legally improper, was \"structural error\" entitling Mr. Pulido to automatic relief and exempted the instructions from \"harmless-error\" review.</p>\n", "question": "<p>Are jury instructions that instruct a jury on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is legally improper, necessarily \"structural error\" that exempts the instructions from a harmless-error review?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>No. In a 6-3 per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit inaccurately categorized the type of jury instructions in Mr. Pulido's case as \"structural error.\" It reasoned that one instructional error arising in the context of multiple theories of guilt does not necessarily spoil all the jury's findings, which would entitle the convicted individual to automatic relief. Rather, the Court found that the jury instructions in Mr. Pulido's case should be evaluated by whether they caused a \"substantial and injurious effect\" upon the jury reaching its verdict. The Court vacated Mr. Pulido's conviction and remanded the case to the court of appeals for proceedings consistent with the decision.</p>\n<p>Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, joined by Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They found the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit merely misused the term \"structural error\" in its opinion, while it actually utilized the analytical model advocated by the majority opinion. They reasoned that in the interests of efficiency, the Supreme Court should have affirmed the court of appeals rather than have it repeat largely the same analysis.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 30243, "name": "Jeremy Friedlander", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/people/jeremy_friedlander", "view_count": 0, "last_name": "Friedlander", "roles": null, "thumbnail": null, "length_of_service": 0, "identifier": "jeremy_friedlander"}, "advocate_description": "argued the cause for the petitioner", "href": "https://api.oyez.org/case_advocate/case_advocate/19854"}, {"advocate": {"ID": 32251, "name": "J.

After his conviction, Mr. Osborne sought access to biological evidence that was used to convict him. He intended to use DNA testing that was not available at the time of the trial to prove he was not the source. The District Attorney's Office (D.A.O.) in Anchorage denied access. Mr. Osborne subsequently filed suit in a federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the D.A.O. alleging that his 14th Amendment due process rights had been violated when he was denied post-conviction access to potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p>The district court granted the D.A.O.'s motion to dismiss and Mr. Osborne appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed and remanded the case. On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Mr. Osborne. The D.A.O. appealed arguing that Mr. Osborne need show the disclosure of evidence would \"affirmatively prove that he is probably innocent\" in order to gain access. Further, it argued that an oral confession given by Mr. Osborne after his conviction precluded him from pursuing post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the district court. It held that Mr. Osborne had a limited due process right of access to the biological evidence for purposes of DNA testing. The court dismissed the D.A.O.'s arguments. It reasoned that Mr. Osborne need merely show that favorable DNA results would afford a \"reasonable probability\" that he could prevail in an action for post-conviction relief. Further, it found that Mr. Osborne's oral confession did not foreclose his pursuit of post-conviction relief, as exculpating evidence would raise serious questions about the validity of his confession.</p>\n", "question": "<p>1) May 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 be used to obtain post-conviction access to evidence when there is no pending claim for which that evidence could be utilized?</p>\n<p>2) Does the 14th Amendment's due process clause afford the plaintiff the right to obtain post-conviction access to evidence when plaintiff's intended claim is foreclosed by evidence obtained through confession?</p>\n", "conclusion": "<p>Maybe and no. The Supreme Court held that even assuming that Mr. Osborne could pursue his claims using \u00a7 1983, he had no constitutional right to obtain post-conviction access to the state's DNA evidence used against him at trial. With Chief Justice John G. Roberts writing for the majority and joined by Justices Antonin G. Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas, the Court deferred to the legislative branch in establishing rules by which convicts can obtain DNA evidence to pursue postconviction relief. It recognized that while the Alaska legislature had yet to establish such procedures, its court system was making progress. Moreover, the Court held that Mr. Osborne's due process rights were not violated, reasoning that Alaska's postconviction relief procedures were adequate.</p>\n<p>Justice Alito also wrote a separate concurring opinion and was joined by Justice Kennedy and in part by Justice Thomas. He agreed with the majority's opinion, but also stated that Mr. Osborne's claim failed for two other reasons. First, he argued that \u00a7 1983 was an inappropriate mechanism for pursuing a federal constitutional right claim when the claim had not been exhausted at the state court level. Second, he argued that Mr. Osborne's claim should be rejected because a defendant who chooses not to have DNA testing done at the trial level for tactical reasons should not have access to such testing in pursuing postconviction relief. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissenting opinion and was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, and in part by Justice David H. Souter. He strongly disagreed with the majority holding that prevented Mr. Osborne from having access to evidence that could conclusively prove his guilt or innocence, and thus could ensure justice had been achieved. Justice Souter also dissented. He argued that Alaska had failed to provide sufficiently effective postconviction relief procedures to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Constitution and thus Mr. Osborne should have had access to the DNA evidence he sought.</p>\n", "advocates": [{"advocate": {"ID": 33955, "name": "Kenneth M.
